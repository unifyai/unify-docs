Editors enable us to manage, modify, save and execute arbitrary files, including Python scripts.
They make it possible for the LLM data flywheel to be run entirely in the browser.

The `UNIFY_API_KEY` environment vairbale is automatically set to your own API key,
which means the `unifyai` package will work out-the-box inside any Python scripts,
without needing to pass your key explicitly.
