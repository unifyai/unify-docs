title: 'Case Study'

So, let's suppose we're building an education app for students.
We will be synthesizing the data for demonstration purposes, such that you can run
everything locally.

Our app needs to do three things:
1. present the user with past exam questions for testing, which then must be marked
2. enable the user to ask *any* question about their subject, which the app should
answer with clarity and accuracy
3. generate *new* questions for the user to answer (not taken from previous exams),
which must also be marked correctly after the user's response

Let's assume we are beta testing the first of these requirements, collecting user
answers but not yet marking them in the app. Simply run this
[notebook]()
with your own API key start streaming the usage data in your own account.

If you're interested how this synthetic data was *generated*, you can check out our data
generation
[notebook](),
but this is *not* necessary for completing the case study.

Now we have some live production traffic streaming in the background. Let's go
ahead and create an interface to monitor and engage with this live traffic.
