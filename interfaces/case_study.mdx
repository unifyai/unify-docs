title: 'Case Study'
---

So, let's suppose we're building an education app for students.

Our app needs to do three things:
1. test the user with past exam questions, which then must be marked
2. answer *any* question the user asks about their subject
3. ask the user *new* questions, which must also be marked

We will be synthesizing the data for demonstration purposes, such that you can run
everything locally.

You can jump straight to any of the following sections, but we would suggest going
in the following order:
[Logging](),
[Evaluations](),
then [Debugging]().

> If you're interested how the various synthetic data for the case study was
> *generated*,
> you can check out our data generation [notebook](), but this is *not* necessary for
> completing the case study. We'll simply be loading this pre-generated data from a
> data store in each of the examples.
