When you first open the interfaces page, you'll see a demo project to run.
The best way to get started is to press the "play" button and run this demo ▶️

When opening this project in a new interface,
you'll see **one tab** (`tab1`) and **two tiles** (`Table` on the left and `View` on the right).

## Tabs

Tabs are shown at the top centre of the screen, and an interface can have as many tabs as you want.

Tabs are useful for separating different concepts and data views within a project, for example: `Datasets`, `Usage`, `Evals`, `Metrics`, `Tests`.

Each tab can be tailored for it's specific purpose, making it easy to juggle all aspects of your project 🤹🏼

## Tiles

Tabs consist of **tiles**, which is where the data, interaction, and visualization actually happens. There are four types:

- tables 🔢
- views 🔍
- plots 📊
- editor 🕹️ (coming soon)

When in edit mode (`Ctrl + E`), new tiles can be added by clicking on any blank space in the tab, pressing `Ctrl + T`, or clicking "+ Add Tile" at the top of the screen.
The corners of the tab can then be dragged for resizing, and the tab can be dragged and repositioned.

If you're done positioning and sizing your tiles, it's best to exit edit mode.
This will declutter the workspace, minimize the icons on screen and make the best use of all the tile space.

## Focus Mode

If you want to look at one tile in particular, you can expand this into the focus mode view,
by clicking the expand button in the top right of the tile.
This will open the tile in focus mode, where other tiles can be positioned alongside for comparison.
You can exit via the top right "X" button to return to the default interface view.

<img className="hidden dark:block" width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unifyai/unifyai.github.io/refs/heads/main/img/externally_linked/focus_mode_dark.gif"/>

Focus mode can also be accessed from the focus mode button at the top the default interface screen.

## Edit / Interactive Modes

Edit mode enables tile manipulation (as explained above) and interactive mode enables engagement with the tiles,
such as applying filters, sorting and grouping on tables, changing the axes selection on plots, and editing logs via the view tile.
When interactive mode is turned off, the interface acts more like a static dashboard, with data manipulation features disabled.
