Interfaces are **fully hackable**, which you can use to build *personalized* pipelines
for: logging, evaluations, guardrails, human labelling, agentic workflows,
self-optimization, and more.

simply `unify.log` your data, and then compose your own custom interface using the four
core building blocks: (1) **tables**, (2) **plots**, (3) **visualizations**, and (4) **terminals**.

Despite the explosion of LLM tools, many of these are inflexible, overly abstracted, and
complex to navigate.

Tooling requirements constantly change across *projects*, across *teams*, and across
*time*. We've therefore made Unify as simple, modular and hackable as possible, so you
can spin up and iterate on the *exact* AI platform that **you** need, in **seconds** ‚ö°

Examples for different applications of **logging**, **debugging**, **evaluating**,
and **interaction**. This is by no means an exhaustive list (you can build an interface
for pretty much *anything*), but it should give you an idea of how flexible and hackable
interfaces are üõ†Ô∏è

Rather than going through *each concept* in detail, we explain interfaces through an
extended *case study*, where we're building an education app for students.
