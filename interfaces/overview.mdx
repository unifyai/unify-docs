Interfaces are **fully hackable**, which you can use to build *custom* interfaces for:
logging, evals, guardrails, labelling, tracing, agents, human-in-the-loop, hyperparam sweeps,
and anything else you can think of ✨

Just `unify.log` your data, and add an interface using the four building blocks:

1.  **tables** 🔢
2.  **views** 🔍
3. **plots** 📊
4. **editor** 🕹️ (coming soon)

Every LLM product has **unique** and **changing** requirements, as do the **users**.
Your infra should reflect this!

We've tried to make Unify as **(a) simple**, **(b) modular** and **(c) hackable** as possible,
so you can quickly probe, analyze, and iterate on the data that's important for **you**, your **product** and your **users** ⚡
