Interfaces are **fully hackable**, which you can use to build *personalized* pipelines for: logging, evaluations, guardrails, human labelling, agentic workflows, self-optimization, and more.

simply `unify.log` your data, and then compose your own custom interface using the four core building blocks: (1) **tables**, (2) **plots**, (3) **visualizations**, and (4) **terminals**.

Despite the explosion of LLM tools, many of these are inflexible, overly abstracted, and complex to navigate.

Tooling requirements constantly change across *projects*, across *teams*, and across *time*. We've therefore made Unify as simple, modular and hackable as possible, so you can spin up and iterate on the *exact* AI platform that **you** need, in **seconds** ‚ö°

Rather than going through each concept in detail, we explain interfaces through a collection of simple examples for different applications of **logging**, **debugging**, **evaluations**, and **data labelling**. This is by no means an exhaustive list (you can build an interface for pretty much *anything*), but it should give you an idea of how flexible and hackable interfaces are üõ†Ô∏è
