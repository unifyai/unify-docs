This answer is 2:100, which does simplify to 1:50, but the working is not clearly shown or justified in a correct way and does not show the correct final statement of 1:50. Because of this confusion, and not presenting 1:50 unambiguously, it would receive no marks.\n\n1(b): The ratio 1:6 of \u00a3350 should give \u00a350 and \u00a3300, but the student\u2019s answer of \u00a3100 and \u00a3250 produces a ratio of 2:5. This is entirely incorrect for the ratio 1:6, so no method or accuracy marks can be awarded.\n\n1(c): 20% of 450 is 90, not 45.

This earns no marks.\n\n3: The markscheme requires a method of 7 \u00d7 (3/8) for the total milk used in a week and a comparison of costs involving 2-litre and 1-litre cartons, leading to a smallest cost of \u00a31.38. The student\u2019s answer of 21 litres per week at \u00a39.79 does not use the correct 3/8-litre-per-day calculation, nor does it compare costs in the correct manner. There is no partial method mark (M1) for the correct daily or weekly volume because 7 \u00d7 3/8 is not used. No final accuracy marks (A1 or B1) are awarded because \u00a39.79 is not the correct or even a \u2018follow-through\u2019 answer. Hence no marks can be given.\n\nOverall, no part of the solution aligns with the markscheme requirements or correct answers, so the total is 0 marks."

Then the cost of red for one tin is 3 \u00d7 \u00a30.50 = \u00a31.50 and the cost of white is 2 \u00d7 \u00a38.00 = \u00a316. So total cost is \u00a317.50. I sell each tin for \u00a340.

My total cost calculation is incorrect and does not match the correct method, losing the third M1. Finally, I subtracted an incorrect cost from an incorrect selling price, so there is no valid profit figure. I did not reach the correct final answer of 25, so I am not eligible for the SC2.
