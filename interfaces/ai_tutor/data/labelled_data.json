The method mark is gained (M1) by showing at least one multiplied decrease (45\u202f000 \u2192 40\u202f500) and the final mark is for stating correctly the shop closes at the end of May once the value is below 35\u202f000.

This uses 1.2 (correct) but an incorrect 10% reduction, so it loses the final accuracy marks. However, it still displays at least partial working by showing a 20% step and attempting a 10% step, earning 2 method marks under the scheme (M1 for the 1.2, M1 for applying 0.9 but incorrectly).

            "answer": "(a) First, note that 3 people put 600 letters in envelopes in 2 hours. So 1 person can put 200 letters in 2 hours. Therefore, 4 people can put 4 \u00d7 200 = 800 letters in 2 hours.\n\n(b) From above, 1 person puts 100 letters in 1 hour. Then 5 people put 1000 letters in 1000 \u00f7 (5 \u00d7 100) = 2 hours. Four people put 1000 letters in 1000 \u00f7 (4 \u00d7 100) = 2.5 hours. The difference is 2.5 \u2212 2 = 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes.\n\n(c) Sam\u2019s assumption that they can work non-stop for 24 hours straight is not realistic. Because of this, she has overestimated the total number of letters they can put in envelopes in one day."
