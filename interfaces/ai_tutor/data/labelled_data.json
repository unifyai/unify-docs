In part (b) the candidate shows the correct calculation for the total mass (35\u202f000 coins each of 5\u202fg = 175\u202fkg) and concludes that Lizzie\u2019s claim is not reasonable, so they earn the method marks (M2) and the final conclusion. However, they omit stating a specific estimate of what weight a typical person can carry (e.g. 20\u201325\u202fkg), so they lose the B1 mark for providing that explicit estimate, leaving them with 3 marks out of 4 for part (b). In part (c) the candidate provides a valid comment on how assumptions (e.g. exact coin weight, no extra container) might affect the answer, earning 1 mark.

            "answer": "(a) To find the total number of 20p coins, first note that \u00a31 requires 5 coins of 20p. So for \u00a37000 you need 7000 \u00d7 5 = 35\u202f000 coins.\n\n(b) Each coin weighs 5 grams, so the total mass is 35\u202f000 \u00d7 5\u202fg = 175\u202f000\u202fg, which is 175\u202fkg. Lizzie\u2019s claim of lifting 175\u202fkg at once is unlikely to be reasonable, so I conclude \u201cNo.\u201d I have assumed all coins weigh exactly 5\u202fg and that they are lifted together without extra packaging.\n\n(c) My answer in part (b) could change if the coins weighed differently, or if they were not all lifted at once. Any change in these assumptions might make it more (or less) feasible to lift the total weight."

The accuracy mark (A1) is awarded for the correct final answer: 35\u202f000 coins. \n\nPart (b) is worth 4 marks. Two method marks (M2) are available for multiplying the total number of coins (their \u201835\u202f000\u2019) by 5 g and converting to kilograms (dividing by 1000): 35\u202f000 \u00d7 5 = 175\u202f000\u202fg = 175\u202fkg. If only one of these steps is correctly shown, then M1 would be awarded instead. One mark is then awarded (B1) for stating a reasonable estimate of how much weight a typical person can lift (e.g. 5\u202fkg up to about 75\u202fkg). Finally, there is a mark (AO3-style) for concluding that Lizzie\u2019s claim is not reasonable, supported by the mass being too large for a typical person to lift.\n\nPart (c) is worth 1 mark. This mark (AO3.5) is awarded for a valid comment about how changing the assumptions (for instance, the typical lifting capacity) would alter the conclusion about whether Lizzie can lift the coins.\n\nAltogether, the solution as presented here secures all 7 marks by demonstrating the correct method, giving the correct answers, showing appropriate working with valid assumptions, and justifying the final conclusion in part (b) along with explaining the effect of assumptions in part (c).",
            "answer": "3(a) Each 20p is \u00a30.20. To get \u00a37000, I calculate:\n   Number of coins = 7000 \u00f7 0.20 = 35\u202f000.\n\n(b) Each 20p coin weighs 5\u202fg, so the total weight is:\n   35\u202f000 coins \u00d7 5\u202fg = 175\u202f000\u202fg.\n   175\u202f000\u202fg = 175\u202fkg.\n\nI assume a typical person can lift something from around 20\u202fkg to maybe 50\u202fkg comfortably. 175\u202fkg is therefore too heavy for one person to lift. So it is not reasonable for Lizzie to claim she can lift \u00a37000 in 20p coins.\n\n(c) If I changed my assumption about how much weight a person might lift, the conclusion could be different. For example, a stronger person might lift more than 75\u202fkg, but the average person would likely find 175\u202fkg too heavy."

            "answer": "(a) There are 100 passengers who spent most of their time playing games.\n\nWorking: According to the pictogram and key, this corresponds to a total of 100 people.\n\n(b) The number of passengers who watched films is 10 more than those who read.\n\nWorking: From the diagram, the difference between film-watchers and readers is 10.\n\n(c) Total passengers = 360. Summing the other categories adds to 310, so there must be 50 passengers listening to music.\n\nWorking:\n1. 360 \u2212 310 = 50.\n2. Each full square is 40 people.\n3. 50 \u2212 40 = 10 left, which is a quarter of a square.\n\nSo I draw one full square and one quarter of a square in the \u2018Listening to music\u2019 row to represent 50 people."

They find the circle\u2019s area as \u03c0, and do 40 \u2212 \u03c0 = 36.86. Although this is very close to the published answer of 36.9 (and matches the method), they do not quote it as 36.9 to three significant figures, so they lose an accuracy mark, but they still earn the method marks.

In part (b), the markscheme similarly awards 1 mark if the student demonstrates that 3/4 + 2/3 is greater than 1 or shows that adding fractions does not involve simply adding numerators and denominators. The student\u2019s answer again fails to note any such reasoning and supports the incorrect calculation, earning 0 marks.

Also, the mark scheme says to note that two decimals multiplied together often result in four decimal places or that 0.4 \u00d7 0.3 is only 0.12, so 0.827 is too large.\n\nFor part (b), we give one mark for noting that 3/4 is 0.75 and 2/3 is about 0.666..., so their sum is clearly more than 1. The answer 5/7 is about 0.71, which is obviously less than each of the individual fractions when added, so it cannot be correct. This meets the mark scheme guidance for an explanation that the result must exceed 1, and 5/7 is clearly under 1.\n\nThese explanations each earn 1 mark, for a total of 2 marks for question 11.",
