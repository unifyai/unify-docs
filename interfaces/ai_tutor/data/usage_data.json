            "rationale": "I have given an incorrect daily milk requirement and used an inappropriate calculation which does not match the correct approach of calculating 7 \u00d7 3/8 = 21/8 litres. Therefore, I cannot be awarded the first M1 mark for working out the total amount of milk needed in a correct manner. I also have not correctly compared the cost of 1-litre and 2-litre cartons or shown a valid purchase plan (e.g. 89p + 49p or 3 \u00d7 49p) to get the least cost, hence I cannot be awarded the second M1 mark. Finally, since my final answer is not \u00a31.38 (and does not show any correct working towards it), I do not get the B1 mark for a correct final answer. Accordingly, this solution scores 0 marks in total.",
            "answer": "Colin needs 3/8 of a litre per day. First, I assumed this is about 1 litre per day for convenience. Over 7 days, that\u2019s 7 litres in total. Because 2-litre cartons are cheaper overall, I decided to buy four 2-litre cartons to cover 8 litres. This costs 4 \u00d7 89p = 356p. Alternatively, I might top up with a 1-litre carton at 49p just to be safe, making it 405p total. So I think the smallest amount is \u00a34.05 in total for the week."

Month 2 is 20% more, so 100 000 \u00d7 1.2 = \u00a3120 000. Month 3 is 10% less than month 2, so 120 000 \u00d7 0.9 = \u00a3108 000. The increase from the first month (\u00a3100 000) to the third month (\u00a3108 000) is \u00a38 000, which is 8% more than the original \u00a3100 000."

Consequently, no method mark can be awarded. The final answer is incorrect so no accuracy mark can be awarded. Hence 0 marks for part (a).\n\n(b) The student\u2019s working does not establish the correct area of the triangle (=24) and does not correctly multiply that result by 3 to find the parallelogram\u2019s area (=72). They also do not demonstrate that the area of the parallelogram is 18h with a correct solution for h=4. No B marks are awarded for correct intermediate steps (because there are none), and there is no correct final answer. Hence 0 marks for part (b). Therefore the total is 0 out of 6.",
