            "answer": "(a) My Pattern 4 has four rows of four dotted squares each, forming a 4\u00d74 block. Then I have four separate blocks of four black squares each around the pattern.\n\n(b) For Pattern 8, the dotted squares go as 1\u00b2=1, 2\u00b2=4, 3\u00b2=9, so at Pattern 8 it will be 8\u00b2=64 dotted squares.\n\n(c) I notice the black squares are 4 in Pattern 1, 8 in Pattern 2, 12 in Pattern 3, so they go up by 4 each time. The first few values are 4, 8, 12.\n\n(d) Sally is right because the black squares are always an even number (multiples of 4). The dotted squares will sometimes be odd, sometimes even, depending on the pattern number. So an odd pattern number has odd dotted squares plus an even number of black squares, giving an odd total. An even pattern number has even dotted squares plus an even number of black squares, giving an even total."

The dotted squares appear to be n\u00b2, which is odd when n is odd and even when n is even. So, when the pattern number is odd, we add an odd number (of dotted squares) to an even number (of black squares), making the total odd.

Around it, place four groups of 4 black squares arranged in the same way as in the previous patterns, making sure each group of 4 black squares shares a side with the dotted region.\n\n(b) To find the number of dotted squares in Pattern 8, note that Pattern 3 uses 3\u00d73=9 dotted squares. Therefore, Pattern 8 will have 8\u00d78=64 dotted squares.\n\n(c) The number of black squares increases in steps of 4 each time (4 for Pattern 1, 8 for Pattern 2, 12 for Pattern 3, etc.). This can be written as 4n for the nth pattern.\n\n(d) Each pattern has black squares, which are always multiples of 4, so the total black squares are even. The dotted squares come from the pattern number squared. When the pattern number is odd, this gives an odd number; when it is even, this gives an even number. Therefore, adding an odd number of dotted squares to an even number of black squares gives an odd total, while adding an even number of dotted squares to an even number of black squares gives an even total. This explains why the overall number of squares is odd for odd-numbered patterns and even for even-numbered patterns."
