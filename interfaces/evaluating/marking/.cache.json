The student should have calculated each year\\u2019s interest and accumulated amount separately to find the total at the end of three years.\\n\\nFor part (b), the explanation given by the student (\\\"the bank might keep the money forever and he could lose it\\\") is incorrect and not a valid concern given the details provided about Account A. The correct reason for potentially avoiding Account A is the restriction on withdrawals for three years, which may not align with Derrick's financial needs if he requires access to his funds sooner.\\n\\nDue to the significant misunderstanding and incorrect calculations in part (a) and the incorrect explanation in part (b), the student earns no marks for this answer.\\n\\n0\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1738229018, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 288, \"prompt_tokens\": 386, \"total_tokens\": 674, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.0038450000000000003}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\nYour task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question,\\nfrom 0 up to a maximum of 6 marks.\\n\\nThe question is:\\n\\n9\\u202f\\u202fThese prisms have different shapes as end faces.\\n\\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502 Shape of end face     \\u2502 Number of faces     \\u2502 Number of edges     \\u2502 Number of vertices  \\u2502\\n \\u251c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u253c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u253c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u253c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2524\\n \\u2502 Triangle (3 sides)    \\u2502 5                   \\u2502 9                   \\u2502 6                   \\u2502\\n \\u2502 Rectangle (4 sides)   \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502 8                   \\u2502\\n \\u2502 Pentagon (5 sides)    \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502 15                  \\u2502 10                  \\u2502\\n \\u2502 Hexagon (6 sides)     \\u2502 8                   \\u2502 18                  \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518\\n\\n(a) Complete this table.\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f[2]\\n\\n(b) How many edges and vertices does a prism with a 100\\u2011sided end face have?

(2 parts red out of 5 total parts equates to 4 litres, and 3 parts white out of 5 total parts equates to 6 litres). This step shows understanding of the ratio and the calculation for the quantities of paint needed. However, the student doesn't mention directly how they arrived at 4 litres of red paint and 6 litres of white paint, but we can infer they understood the ratio correctly.\\n\\n2. **Calculate the cost of red paint:**\\n   - Red paint costs \\u00a380 per 10 litres, so 4 litres would cost \\u00a380 \\u00d7 (4/10) = \\u00a332. The student's response doesn't explicitly mention this calculation.\\n\\n3. **Calculate the cost of white paint:**\\n   - White paint costs \\u00a35 per 10 litres, so 6 litres would cost \\u00a35 \\u00d7 (6/10) = \\u00a33. The student's response doesn't explicitly mention this calculation.\\n\\n4. **Determine the total cost of producing 10 litres of pink paint:**\\n   - Total cost = \\u00a332 (red paint) + \\u00a33 (white paint) = \\u00a335. The student's response doesn't mention this total.\\n\\n5. **Calculate the profit for each 10-litre tin sold:**\\n   - Selling price per tin = \\u00a360, so profit is \\u00a360 - \\u00a335 = \\u00a325 per tin sold. The student's response doesn't mention this calculation.\\n\\nThe student's answer correctly identifies the quantities of paint required per 10-litre batch, which is an essential component of the solution. However, it lacks critical calculations and explanations for how to determine the costs and profit, which are necessary for full marks. The student hasn't shown their working adequately, as the answer misses cost calculations and the final profit determination entirely.\\n\\nGiven these observations, the student's response is incomplete for a full solution, as it only handles the ratio aspect. Therefore, I would award marks for demonstrating understanding of the ratio part, but not more, as the core mathematical calculations and final profit determination are omitted.\\n\\n2\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1738258557, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 476, \"prompt_tokens\": 233, \"total_tokens\": 709, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.0053425}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\nYour task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question,\\nfrom 0 up to a maximum of {'total': 2} marks.\\n\\nThe question is:\\n\\n2  Write these in order, smallest first:\\n\\n    0.34    1/3    3.5%\\n\\n    \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026   \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026   \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026  [2]\\n             smallest\\n\\n\\nThe markscheme for the question is:\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"_\\\": \\\"Answer: 3.5%, 1/3, 0.34 (2 marks)\\\\n\\\\nPart marks and guidance:\\\\n\\\\u2022 B1 for 1/3 = 0.33\\\\u2026 or 33\\\\u2026%\\\\n\\\\u2022 or B1 for 0.34 = 34%\\\\n\\\\u2022 or B1 for changing 3.5% to 0.035\\\\n\\\\u2022 or SC1 for 1/3, 0.34, 3.5%\\\\n\\\\nAccept correct order with equivalent values.\\\"\\n}\\n\\n\\nTheir answer to this question is:\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"_\\\": \\\"1(a) 40:220 (Incorrect attempt)\\\\n\\\\n1(b) \\\\u00a350 and \\\\u00a3300 (Incorrect attempt)\\\\n\\\\n1(c) 90 (Incorrect attempt)\\\\n\\\\n2) 1/3, 0.34, 3.5%\\\\n\\\\n3) \\\\u00a33.00 (Incorrect attempt)\\\"\\n}\\n\\n\\nAs the very final part of your response, simply provide the number of marks on a\\n*new line*, without any additional formatting.

You should ignore\\n leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237\\n would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen\\nanywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an\\nacceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by\\nthe instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks\\nunless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(ii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but the answer line is blank, allow full marks. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the\\ncorrect answer.\\n\\n(iii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but a completely different answer is seen on the answer line, then accuracy marks for\\nthe answer are lost. Method marks could still be awarded. Use the M0, M1, M2 annotations as appropriate and place the annotation \\uf0fb\\nnext to the wrong answer.\\n\\n8.\\nIn questions with a final answer line:\\n\\n(i)If one answer is provided on the answer line, mark the method that leads to that answer.\\n\\n(ii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is a single method provided, award method marks only.\\n\\n(iii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is more than one method provided, award zero marks for the question\\nunless the candidate has clearly indicated which method is to be marked.\\n\\n9.\\nIn questions with no final answer line:\\n\\n(i)If a single response is provided, mark as usual.\\n\\n(ii)If more than one response is provided, award zero marks for the question unless the candidate has clearly indicated which response is to be\\nmarked.\\n\\n10.\\nWhen the data of a question is consistently misread in such a way as not to alter the nature or difficulty of the question, please follow the\\ncandidate\\u2019s work and allow follow through for **A** and **B** marks. Deduct 1 mark\\nfrom any **A** or **B** marks earned and record this by using the MR annotation.\\n**M** marks are not deducted for misreads.\\n\\n11.\\nUnless the question asks for an answer to a specific degree of accuracy, always mark at the greatest number of significant figures even if\\nthis is rounded or truncated on the answer line. For example, an answer in the mark scheme is 15.75, which is seen in the working. The\\ncandidate then rounds or truncates this to 15.8, 15 or 16 on the answer line. Allow full marks for the 15.75.\\n\\n12.\\nRanges of answers given in the mark scheme are always inclusive.\\n\\n13.\\nFor methods not provided for in the mark scheme give as far as possible equivalent marks for equivalent work.\\n\\n14.\\nAnything in the mark scheme which is in square brackets [\\u2026] is not required for the mark to be earned, but if present it must be correct.\\n\\n15.\\nThe answers stated are always the student's *complete* response, if no working is included, then we must assume that the student did not perform any intermediate working steps.\\n\\n16.\\nWhen marking text-based explanations from the student, you should only deem a line of reasoning to be \\\"valid\\\" if it uses information provided in the question and/or is somewhat mathematical in nature. If the answer is technically plausible but is unrealistic and/or misses the point, then marks should not be awarded.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe question you need to mark is:\\n\\n9\\u202f\\u202fThese prisms have different shapes as end faces.\\n\\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502 Shape of end face     \\u2502 Number of faces     \\u2502 Number of edges     \\u2502 Number of vertices  \\u2502\\n \\u251c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u253c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u253c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u253c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2524\\n \\u2502 Triangle (3 sides)    \\u2502 5                   \\u2502 9                   \\u2502 6                   \\u2502\\n \\u2502 Rectangle (4 sides)   \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502 8                   \\u2502\\n \\u2502 Pentagon (5 sides)    \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502 15                  \\u2502 10                  \\u2502\\n \\u2502 Hexagon (6 sides)     \\u2502 8                   \\u2502 18                  \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518\\n\\n(a) Complete this table.\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f[2]\\n\\n(b) How many edges and vertices does a prism with a 100\\u2011sided end face have?
