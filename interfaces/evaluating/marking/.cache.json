Answers to part questions which are being followed through are indicated by e.g. FT 3 \\u00d7 their (a).\\n\\nFor questions with FT available you must ensure that you refer back to the relevant previous answer.

You should ignore leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen anywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an acceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by the instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks unless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.

You should ignore leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen anywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an acceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by the instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks unless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(ii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but the answer line is blank, allow full marks. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(iii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but a completely different answer is seen on the answer line, then accuracy marks for the answer are lost. Method marks could still be awarded. Use the M0, M1, M2 annotations as appropriate and place the annotation \\uf0fb next to the wrong answer.\\n\\n8.\\nIn questions with a final answer line:\\n\\n(i)If one answer is provided on the answer line, mark the method that leads to that answer.\\n\\n(ii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is a single method provided, award method marks only.\\n\\n(iii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is more than one method provided, award zero marks for the question unless the candidate has clearly indicated which method is to be marked.\\n\\n9.\\nIn questions with no final answer line:\\n\\n(i)If a single response is provided, mark as usual.\\n\\n(ii)If more than one response is provided, award zero marks for the question unless the candidate has clearly indicated which response is to be marked.\\n\\n10.\\nWhen the data of a question is consistently misread in such a way as not to alter the nature or difficulty of the question, please follow the candidate\\u2019s work and allow follow through for **A** and **B** marks. Deduct 1 mark from any **A** or **B** marks earned and record this by using the MR annotation. **M** marks are not deducted for misreads.\\n\\n11.\\nUnless the question asks for an answer to a specific degree of accuracy, always mark at the greatest number of significant figures even if this is rounded or truncated on the answer line. For example, an answer in the mark scheme is 15 75, which is seen in the working. The candidate then rounds or truncates this to 15.8, 15 or 16 on the answer line. Allow full marks for the 15.75.\\n\\n12.\\nRanges of answers given in the mark scheme are always inclusive.\\n\\n13.\\nFor methods not provided for in the mark scheme give as far as possible equivalent marks for equivalent work.\\n\\n14.\\nAnything in the mark scheme which is in square brackets [\\u2026] is not required for the mark to be earned, but if present it must be correct.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe question you need to mark is:\\n\\n10 The graph shows the number of ice creams sold in a shop each day against the temperature at midday that day.\\n\\n(a) (i) Describe the relationship between the temperature at midday and the number of ice creams sold.

Allow full marks for the 15.75.\\n\\n12.\\nRanges of answers given in the mark scheme are always inclusive.\\n\\n13.\\nFor methods not provided for in the mark scheme give as far as possible equivalent marks for equivalent work.\\n\\n14.\\nAnything in the mark scheme which is in square brackets [\\u2026] is not required for the mark to be earned, but if present it must be correct.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe question you need to mark is:\\n\\n17  180 g of copper is mixed with 105 g of zinc to make an alloy.  \\n    The density of copper is 9 g/cm\\u00b3.  \\n    The density of zinc is 7 g/cm\\u00b3.  \\n\\n(a)  Work out the volume of copper used in the alloy.  \\n     (a) \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026. cm\\u00b3  [2]  \\n\\n(b)  What is the density of the alloy?  \\n     (b) \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026 g/cm\\u00b3 [4]\\n\\nThe sub-question breakdown, including each sub-question, it's associated markscheme and it's associated answer, are as follows:\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"a\\\": {\\n        \\\"sub-question\\\": \\\"Work out the volume of copper used in the alloy.\\\",\\n        \\\"markscheme\\\": \\\"\\\\nFirstly, the mark types have the following meanings:\\\\n\\\\nM:/nM1 (1 mark) should be awarded if a correct method is used, and should not be lost for purely numerical errors.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith these definitions in mind, marks should be awarded as follows:\\\\n  20\\\\n\\\\n2 marks\\\\nCan be implied by an answer of 2.\\\\nM1 for D = M / V soi\\\",\\n        \\\"answer\\\": \\\"Volume of copper = 180 \\\\u00f7 9 = 20 cm\\\\u00b3.\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"b\\\": {\\n        \\\"sub-question\\\": \\\"What is the density of the alloy?\\\",\\n        \\\"markscheme\\\": \\\"\\\\nFirstly, the mark types have the following meanings:\\\\n\\\\nM:/nM2 (2 marks) should be awarded if a correct method is used, and should not be lost for purely numerical errors.\\\\n\\\\nM:/nM1 (1 mark) should be awarded if a correct method is used, and should not be lost for purely numerical errors.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith these definitions in mind, marks should be awarded as follows:\\\\n  8 1/7 or 8.14[\\\\u2026]\\\\n\\\\n4 marks\\\\nM1 for 15 or 105 \\\\u00f7 7\\\\nAND 180 + 105\\\\nM2 for their(20 + 15)\\\\n         18 + 10.5\\\\n   or their(2 + 1.5)\\\\nOr M1 for some attempt to find total mass / total volume\\\",\\n        \\\"answer\\\": \\\"Total mass of alloy = 180 + 105 = 285 g.\\\\nVolume of copper = 20 cm\\\\u00b3.\\\\nVolume of zinc = 105 \\\\u00f7 7 = 15 cm\\\\u00b3.\\\\nTotal volume = 20 + 15 = 35 cm\\\\u00b3.\\\\nDensity of alloy = 285 \\\\u00f7 35 = 8.14 g/cm\\\\u00b3 (approximately).\\\"\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\nFor each sub-question [\\\"a\\\", \\\"b\\\"], you should populate the `reasoning` field with your initial reasoning about the correct number of marks to award.
