There are 3 pairs in which they sit together: [A, C], [C, A], and switching seats with Bob allows [B, A, C] and [B, C, A]. Altogether, this covers 4 outcomes, giving a probability of 4/6, which reduces to 2/3. This part is correct, earning 1 mark.\\n\\n(a)(iii) The student correctly identifies one suitable arrangement where Bob sits in seat 1 with Ann next to him: B, A, C. Out of the 6 possible arrangements, this gives a probability of 1/6. Therefore, this part is correct, earning 1 mark.\\n\\n(b) The student correctly calculates the number of extra nights if they book early. Without the discount, the budget allows for 10 nights (\\u00a3500 / \\u00a350 per night). With the 20% discount (making the cost \\u00a340 per night), they can stay 12 nights (\\u00a3500 / \\u00a340 per night). The difference is 2 extra nights.

Answers to part questions which are being followed through are indicated by e.g. FT\\n3 \\u00d7 their (a).\\n\\nFor questions with FT available you must ensure that you refer back to the relevant previous answer. You may find it easier to mark these\\nquestions candidate by candidate rather than question by question.\\n\\n4.\\nWhere dependent (dep) marks are indicated in the mark scheme, you must check that the candidate has met all the criteria specified for the\\nmark to be awarded.\\n\\n5.\\nThe following abbreviations are commonly found in GCSE Mathematics mark schemes.\\n- **figs 237**, for example, means any answer with only these digits. You should ignore \\n leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 \\n would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen \\nanywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an \\nacceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by \\nthe instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks\\nunless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.

Therefore M0 A1 cannot be awarded.\\nB marks are independent of M (method) marks and are for a correct final answer, a partially correct answer, or a correct intermediate stage.\\nSC marks are for special cases that are worthy of some credit.\\n\\n2.\\nUnless the answer and marks columns of the mark scheme specify M and A marks etc, or the mark scheme is \\u2018banded\\u2019, then if the correct\\nanswer is clearly given and is not from wrong working full marks should be awarded.\\n\\nDo not award the marks if the answer was obtained from an incorrect method, i.e. incorrect working is seen and the correct answer clearly follows\\nfrom it.\\n\\n3.\\nWhere follow through (FT) is indicated in the mark scheme, marks can be awarded where the candidate\\u2019s work follows correctly from a\\nprevious answer whether or not it was correct.\\n\\nFigures or expressions that are being followed through are sometimes encompassed by single quotation marks after the word their for clarity,\\ne.g. FT 180 \\u00d7 (their \\u201837\\u2019 + 16), or FT 300 \\u2013 \\uf0d6(their \\u201852 + 72\\u2019). Answers to part questions which are being followed through are indicated by e.g. FT\\n3 \\u00d7 their (a).\\n\\nFor questions with FT available you must ensure that you refer back to the relevant previous answer.

You should ignore \\n leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 \\n would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen \\nanywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an \\nacceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by \\nthe instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks\\nunless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.

Therefore, the student earns 1 mark for this part.\\n\\nIn part (b)(i), the student correctly calculates the error interval for y as 4.125 \\u2264 y < 4.135, identifying and applying the correct error bounds for rounding to two decimal places. The student thus earns the full 2 marks for this part.\\n\\nIn part (b)(ii), the student incorrectly states the error interval for z. The correct interval should be 4650 \\u2264 z < 4750. The error might arise from not correctly applying rounding to two significant figures similar to the rule for increasing and decreasing by half of the rounding unit. However, the student\\u2019s reasoning shows engagement with the concept of error intervals, acknowledging rounding, though executed incorrectly.\\n\\nNo partial marks are awarded in part (b)(ii) since neither bound is correctly identified and used, in contrast to the instruction that B1 is earned for either limit with correct inequality signs.
