They also equated the outcome to a massive and incorrect amount of \\u00a390,000 from an initial \\u00a310,000, revealing a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem.\\n\\nTo solve this correctly for Account A, compound interest is calculated using the formula \\\\( A = P(1 + r)^n \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is the principal amount (\\u00a310,000), \\\\( r \\\\) is the rate (0.03), and \\\\( n \\\\) is the number of years (3). For Account B, interest is calculated year-by-year. The student should have calculated each year\\u2019s interest and accumulated amount separately to find the total at the end of three years.\\n\\nFor part (b), the explanation given by the student (\\\"the bank might keep the money forever and he could lose it\\\") is incorrect and not a valid concern given the details provided about Account A. The correct reason for potentially avoiding Account A is the restriction on withdrawals for three years, which may not align with Derrick's financial needs if he requires access to his funds sooner.\\n\\nDue to the significant misunderstanding and incorrect calculations in part (a) and the incorrect explanation in part (b), the student earns no marks for this answer.\\n\\n0\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1738229018, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 288, \"prompt_tokens\": 386, \"total_tokens\": 674, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.0038450000000000003}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\nYour task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question,\\nfrom 0 up to a maximum of 6 marks.\\n\\nThe question is:\\n\\n9\\u202f\\u202fThese prisms have different shapes as end faces.\\n\\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502 Shape of end face     \\u2502 Number of faces     \\u2502 Number of edges     \\u2502 Number of vertices  \\u2502\\n \\u251c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u253c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u253c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u253c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2524\\n \\u2502 Triangle (3 sides)    \\u2502 5                   \\u2502 9                   \\u2502 6                   \\u2502\\n \\u2502 Rectangle (4 sides)   \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502 8                   \\u2502\\n \\u2502 Pentagon (5 sides)    \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502 15                  \\u2502 10                  \\u2502\\n \\u2502 Hexagon (6 sides)     \\u2502 8                   \\u2502 18                  \\u2502 \\u2026                   \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518\\n\\n(a) Complete this table.\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f[2]\\n\\n(b) How many edges and vertices does a prism with a 100\\u2011sided end face have?
