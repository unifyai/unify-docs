The student correctly solves for b as 15, and they have set up the equation as suggested in the markscheme. Thus they should be awarded 2 out of 3 marks. They miss 1 mark due to the incorrect final box number (37 instead of 36).

If the answer is technically plausible but is unrealistic and/or misses the point, then marks should not be awarded.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe question you need to mark is:\\n\\n10 The graph shows the number of ice creams sold in a shop each day against the temperature at midday that day.\\n\\n(a) (i) Describe the relationship between the temperature at midday and the number of ice creams sold. [1]  \\n(ii) One data point is an outlier. Give a reason why this does not fit the rest of the data. [1]\\n\\n(b) Use the scatter graph to predict the number of ice creams sold on a day when the temperature at midday was:  \\n(i) 22\\u00b0C [1]  \\n(ii) 28\\u00b0C [1]  \\n(iii) Explain which of these two predictions is more reliable. [2]\\n\\n(c) A newspaper headline reads:  \\n\\u201cHigh temperatures make more people buy ice cream!\\u201d\\n\\nDoes the graph above prove this claim? Give a reason for your decision. [2]\\n\\n\\nThe markscheme for this specific question is:\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"a.i\\\": \\\"Answer: Positive correlation (1 mark)\\\\nGuidance: Condone 'positive' or correct description, e.g. 'As the temperature increases, more ice creams are sold'.\\\",\\n    \\\"a.ii\\\": \\\"Answer: Correct reason, e.g. 'He sold far more ice creams than you would expect him to for a 20\\\\u00b0C day' (1 mark).\\\",\\n    \\\"b.i\\\": \\\"Answer: 75\\\\u201395 (1 mark).\\\",\\n    \\\"b.ii\\\": \\\"Answer: 140\\\\u2013170 (1 mark).\\\",\\n    \\\"b.iii\\\": \\\"Answer: The (b)(i) prediction is more reliable, as it is within the range of the given data (2 marks)\\\\nGuidance: B1 for (b)(i) prediction identified with partial reason.\\\",\\n    \\\"c\\\": \\\"Answer: No, because there may be other factors involved (2 marks)\\\\nGuidance: B1 for 'No', with partial reason.\\\"\\n}\\n\\n\\nThe student's answer to this question (which you need to marked) is:\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"a.i\\\": \\\"As the midday temperature goes up, the number of ice creams sold seems to go up as well.\\\",\\n    \\\"a.ii\\\": \\\"That day, the shop sold a much larger number of ice creams than the other days with the same temperature.\\\",\\n    \\\"b.i\\\": \\\"About 80 ice creams.\\\",\\n    \\\"b.ii\\\": \\\"About 150 ice creams.\\\",\\n    \\\"b.iii\\\": \\\"The prediction for 22\\\\u00b0C is more reliable, because 22\\\\u00b0C is inside the range of the data shown on the graph (interpolation), whereas 28\\\\u00b0C is outside the main cluster of points (extrapolation).\\\",\\n    \\\"c\\\": \\\"No. The graph alone does not completely prove the claim, because we cannot be certain this trend always holds true in all situations.\\\"\\n}\\n\\n\\nFor each sub-question [\\\"a.i\\\", \\\"a.ii\\\", \\\"b.i\\\", \\\"b.ii\\\", \\\"b.iii\\\", \\\"c\\\"], you should populate the `reasoning` field with your initial reasoning about the correct number of marks to award. Finally, you should put the number of marks to award for this sub-question in the `marks` field.\\n\"}], \"seed\": 0, \"temperature\": 1.0, \"stream\": false, \"extra_body\": {\"signature\": \"python\", \"use_custom_keys\": false, \"tags\": null, \"drop_params\": true, \"region\": null, \"log_query_body\": true, \"log_response_body\": true, \"extra_body\": {}}}": "{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-AwWKRMz3iGh48AetPmqFT4vp4ztIZ\", \"choices\": [{\"finish_reason\": \"stop\", \"index\": 0, \"logprobs\": null, \"message\": {\"content\": \"{\\n  \\\"a.i\\\": {\\n    \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"The answer describes a positive correlation by stating that as the temperature increases so does the number of ice creams sold.
