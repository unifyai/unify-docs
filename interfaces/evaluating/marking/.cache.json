After placing 8 in the Dog-only part, the remaining students with dogs (21 - 8 = 13) must be in the intersection to account for those who have both a dog and a cat.\\n\\n2.

This shows they understand the concept of summing angles in the triangle and using algebra to solve for x. This meets the requirement for 1 mark (AO2.4a).\\n\\n3. Calculation and final answer: The student simplifies the equation to 2x + 40 = 180, then to 2x = 140, and finally solves for x = 70\\u00b0. This shows correct algebraic manipulation and arrives at the correct answer for x.

This shows understanding that 25% = 1/4 of the rent.\\n   - According to the markscheme, recognizing that 1/4 (25%) of the rent is \\u00a3450 earns them M1.

For \\\"Playing games\\\", there are 3 full squares and one half square. This equates to:\\n  - 3 full squares = 3 \\u00d7 40 = 120 people.\\n  - However, checking the correct answer in the markscheme, it states that the correct answer should be 100. This seems like a markscheme error because the student's answer of 100 matches the correct analysis given 3.5 squares.\\n\\nThe answer given by the student is \\\"100\\\". The markscheme solution for (a) is indeed \\\"100\\\", so this is correct.\\n\\n- **Mark awarded for (a): 1/1.**\\n\\n### Part (b):\\n\\nThe question is: *How many more passengers spent most of their time watching films than reading?*\\n\\n- Watching films: 3 full squares + 0.5 squares = 3.5 squares = 3.5 \\u00d7 40 = 140 people.\\n- Reading: 3 full squares = 3 \\u00d7 40 = 120 people.\\n- The difference is 140 - 120 = 20 people.\\n\\nThe answer given by the student is \\\"30\\\". The correct answer according to the markscheme is \\\"10\\\", but the accurate calculation should be \\\"20\\\". It appears the markscheme is inconsistent regarding the interpretation of the pictogram, however, given both calculations on \\\"films\\\" and \\\"reading\\\" based on 3 full squares and 3.5 for each respectively, \\\"20\\\" is correct through plausible logic but \\\"10\\\" implies potentially missed transcriptions or half-credible total scope dealing.\\n\\nTherefore, the student should have answered \\\"20\\\" and receives no marks.\\n\\n- **Mark awarded for (b): 0/1.**\\n\\n### Part (c):\\n\\nThe question states there were 360 passengers. We need to allocate the number of passengers who listened to music using the remaining people from the known categories. \\n\\n- Total already accounted by other activities:\\n  - Reading: 120 people.\\n  - Watching films: 140 people.\\n  - Games: 120 people.\\n  - Other: 2 full squares = 2 \\u00d7 40 = 80 people.\\n  - The sum is 120 + 140 + 120 + 80 = 460 people.\\n  \\nThe interpretation should reasonably sum to real conditions for remaining passengers out of the total 360, so re-calculating leftover population dynamically correct as:\\n- Already accounted number sums 360 - (460 - 80) = 80; therefore calculated through 80 (-40) followed through pictorial segments correctly for \\\"listening to music.\\\"\\n\\n- Let's consider: \\n  - The sum logically provides finishing with an evidently correct pictorial completeness.\\n\\n- The student incorrectly provided \\\"120\\\" and mentioned drawing \\\"three squares\\\", which would show 120 people rather than the correct calculation of adding smaller increments. The student missed the subtraction logic for a feasible count of remaining 50 since 310 computed Indeed counted over and causes conflict. So one and a quarter squares must be represented.\\n\\nOn this basis we assess how the student arrived at 50 through a misconstrued notion adding too much thereby accounting potential emergent error in mixed operations without focus.\\n\\n- **Mark awarded for (c): 0/3.** (Referance sub-calculation concerned by distributing to reasonable estimation via assumptions.)\\n\\nOverall, the calculations show that due to errors in logical following, and mismatching of logic via mistake in finalist square formations, no marks are strictly available from deeper solving failures while getting proper details and careful viability tested.\\n\\n\\n**Number of marks awarded overall:**\\n\\n1\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1738117321, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 788, \"prompt_tokens\": 579, \"total_tokens\": 1367, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.009327499999999999}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\nYour task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question,\\nfrom 0 up to a maximum of 2 marks.\\n\\nThe general marking guidelines (relevant for all questions) are as follows:\\n\\n----\\n\\n1.\\nM marks are for using a correct method and are not lost for purely numerical errors.\\nA marks are for an accurate answer and depend on preceding M (method) marks.

This matches the Marking Guideline's condition M1 for 1/4 (of the rent) = 450.\\n\\n4. **Finding the total rent**:\\n   - The student correctly calculates the full rent with \\\"450 \\u00d7 4 = \\u00a31800.\\\" This is the direct application of multiplying the known rent portion by 4 to find the total rent, matching M1 for 450 \\u00d7 4, or equivalent, using percentages or decimals.\\n\\n5. **Final answer**:\\n   - The student delivers the final answer: \\\"Therefore, they pay \\u00a31800 altogether.\\\" This is both shown in the working and clearly stated. \\n\\n6. **Comparing with Marking Scheme**:\\n   - The student got the total rent calculation right and provided a clear and thorough explanation and calculation of each step that aligns with the mark scheme.

Thus, the student earns the full 2 marks for this part.\\n\\n### Part (b)(ii)\\n- **Student's Answer:** \\\"4650 \\u2264 z \\u2264 4750\\\"\\n- **Markscheme Required Answer:** \\\"4650 \\u2264 z < 4750\\\"\\n- **Mark Scheme Details:** \\n  - 2 marks in total.\\n  - 1 AO1.2, 1 AO1.3a.\\n  - B1 is for either limit with the correct inequality sign.\\n  - Condone using x instead of z.\\n- **Evaluation:** The student's answer correctly states the lower limit of \\\"4650\\\" and the upper limit of \\\"4750\\\". However, there is an issue with the inequality sign on the upper bound; it should be \\\"<\\\" instead of \\\"\\u2264\\\". This mistake affects the precision of the definition of the interval. According to the markscheme details, while B1 can be awarded for either correct limit with the correct inequality sign, here, only one limit has been correctly noted with the inequality sign, so only partial credit can be given. Therefore, the student can receive 1 mark for identifying the correct limits but misses 1 mark due to the incorrect inequality sign on the upper limit.\\n\\nCombining all parts, the student's total marks are the sum of each evaluated component:\\n\\n1 (part a) + 2 (part b(i)) + 1 (part b(ii)) = 4\\n\\n4\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1738121084, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 534, \"prompt_tokens\": 1713, \"total_tokens\": 2247, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 1024}, \"cost\": 0.009622499999999999}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\nYour task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question,\\nfrom 0 up to a maximum of 6 marks.\\n\\nThe general marking guidelines (relevant for all questions) are as follows:\\n\\n----\\n\\n1.\\nM marks are for using a correct method and are not lost for purely numerical errors.\\nA marks are for an accurate answer and depend on preceding M (method) marks.

Thus, they conclude that 21 cannot be part of the sequence.\\n\\n2. **Mark Scheme:** The marking guidance indicates a method mark for attempting to solve for n using 3n + 5, and showing that the solution is not an integer (e.g., 21^(5/3), or by demonstrating calculation 20 < 21 < 23).\\n\\n3. **Evaluation:** The student has correctly calculated and explained why 21 is not part of the sequence through valid algebraic manipulation of the given sequence formula. The explanation is clear and accurate.\\n\\n4. **Marks Awarded:** The student is awarded 2 marks according to the mark scheme, as they correctly articulate the reasoning and demonstrate accurate algebra work to show the lack of an integer solution.\\n\\n**Part (b.i):**\\n\\n1. **Student's Response:** The student has chosen the rule \\\"Double the previous term\\\" to continue the sequence. The next two terms they provide are 8 and 15.\\n\\n2. **Mark Scheme:** A valid rule with two correct subsequent terms earns marks. The correct continuation of doubling for terms 4 would be 4 (2*2) = 8, and then 8 (2*4). However, the provided terms were 8 and 15, a mistake in calculation, especially the term \\\"15,\\\" which indicates an incorrect follow-through from their proposed rule.\\n\\n3. **Evaluation:** The student correctly identified a valid rule but failed to follow it correctly through to produce the subsequent terms from the sequence. The erroneous \\\"15\\\" shows incorrect follow-through on the doubling rule, which should have resulted in 8, 16.\\n\\n4. **Marks Awarded:** The student is awarded 1 mark. Although they correctly suggested a valid rule, they failed to accurately calculate the next two terms according to that rule.\\n\\n**Part (b.ii):**\\n\\n1. **Student's Response:** Rule 2 stated is \\\"Add 10 each time,\\\" with the next two terms provided as 14 and 20.\\n\\n2. **Mark Scheme:** As with the first rule, a valid rule proposal along with correctly calculated next two terms earns marks.\\n\\n3. **Evaluation:** The student's rule \\\"Add 10 each time\\\" is valid. However, the starting sequence they need to continue from is 1, 2, 4, making the next terms by using (4+10=14, then 14+10=24), but they wrote 20, which doesn't align with their rule. The correct sequence should be 14, 24.\\n\\n4. **Marks Awarded:** The student is given 1 mark for proposing a valid alternative rule, but they miscalculated one of the next terms based on that rule, resulting in a calculation error for \\\"20\\\" where \\\"24\\\" would be correct.\\n\\nOverall, the student's calculation and understanding are clear in some areas but falter in others:\\n\\n6\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1738121083, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 669, \"prompt_tokens\": 1868, \"total_tokens\": 2537, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.011359999999999999}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\nYour task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question,\\nfrom 0 up to a maximum of 4 marks.\\n\\nThe general marking guidelines (relevant for all questions) are as follows:\\n\\n----\\n\\n1.\\nM marks are for using a correct method and are not lost for purely numerical errors.\\nA marks are for an accurate answer and depend on preceding M (method) marks.

The method they used aligns with the rule described in the question, which involves adding consecutive numbers in the series. Since this part required a single mark for an accurate answer with method appropriately shown, the student is awarded the full mark.\\n\\n**Award for (a):**\\n1 mark\\n\\n**Part (b):**\\n\\n- **Correct Answer Required:** 8, 13, 21 (with marks specified: 1 AO1.3a, 1 AO3.1a, and M1 for a correct subtraction).\\n- **Student's Answer:** \\\"The missing numbers are 8, 13 and 21.\\\"\\n- **Working:** \\\"55 \\u2212 34 = 21, then 34 \\u2212 21 = 13, then 21 \\u2212 13 = 8. So the full sequence is 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.\\\"\\n\\n**Analysis for (b):**\\n\\n- The student successfully identified the correct missing numbers: 8, 13, and 21 by reversing the addition process used in the question (subtraction in reverse). They did the subtractions accurately and presented the full sequence. The method used is correct; hence, the student earns both method and accuracy marks.\\n\\n**Award for (b):**\\n2 marks\\n\\n**Part (c):**\\n\\n- **Correct Answer Required:** a + b, a + 2b, 2a + 3b\\n- **Student's Answer:** \\n  - \\\"The third box is a + b.\\\"\\n  - \\\"The fourth box is (a + b) + b = a + 2b.\\\"\\n  - \\\"The fifth box is (a + b) + (a + 2b) = 2a + 3b.\\\"\\n\\n**Analysis for (c):**\\n\\n- The student's answer matches the correct expressions step by step. They correctly derive each expression: starting from a + b, then adding b to make a + 2b, and finally, adding the second and third boxes to achieve 2a + 3b. Since two or more correct expressions result in awarding full marks for M1 and AO1.3a, the student receives full marks on this part.\\n\\n**Award for (c):**\\n2 marks\\n\\n**Part (d):**\\n\\n- **Correct Answer Required:** 15, 21, 36\\n- **Guidance:** The method involves using the derived expression 2a + 3b = 57 and a = 6, solving for b, and filling the boxes.\\n- **Student's Answer:** \\n  - \\\"Set 2a + 3b = 57 with a = 6: 2\\u00d76 + 3b = 57 \\u2192 12 + 3b = 57 \\u2192 3b = 45 \\u2192 b = 15.\\\"\\n  - \\\"So the second box is 15, the third box is 21, and I then added 15 + 21 = 37 for the fourth box, before 57. Hence the row is 6, 15, 21, 37, 57.\\\"\\n\\n**Analysis for (d):**\\n\\n- The student correctly uses the equation 2a + 3b = 57, substitutes a = 6 to solve for b, and finds b = 15. They correctly determine the second and third boxes values, 15 and 21. However, there is an error in the final row; they incorrectly state 37 instead of the expected 36. Despite this error, the first two values were correctly placed, and the method marks for setting up the equation and substitution apply. Thus, the student earns partial credit.\\n\\n**Award for (d):**\\n2 marks (M1 for solving 2a + 3b with given a, and another M1 for using calculated b, but a last mark lost for final incorrect box sequence).\\n\\nNow summing up the marks for each part:\\n\\n1 (a) + 2 (b) + 2 (c) + 2 (d) = 7\\n\\n7\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1738121084, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 992, \"prompt_tokens\": 2269, \"total_tokens\": 3261, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.015592499999999999}}"}
