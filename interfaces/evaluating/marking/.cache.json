Let's evaluate each part:\\n\\n9(a)(i): The student was required to list all possible seating orders. The possible seating arrangements for three people are A B C, A C B, B A C, B C A, C A B, and C B A. The student incorrectly repeated A B C, and provided only two other incorrect attempts (B B A and C C A are not valid). \\nThis part scores 0 marks because none of the correct additional permutations was provided.\\n\\n9(a)(ii): The probability of Ann and Carol sitting together can be determined by grouping them and considering them as one unit. The valid pairs can be AC B or CA B in some order, with two remaining combinations for B. Thus, the correct probability is 1/3. The student answered 1/4, which is incorrect.\\nThis part scores 0 marks.\\n\\n9(a)(iii): The probability that Bob sits in seat 1 with Ann next to him is found by considering B in the first seat and either A directly after, AC or AB. Thus, there are only two valid possibilities: B A followed by C or B A followed by C. Out of 6 possible arrangements overall (as there are 3! = 6 permutations), this yields a probability of 2/6 = 1/3, which matches the student's answer.\\nThis part scores 1 mark.\\n\\n9(b): Calculating 20% discount on \\u00a350 is \\u00a350 x 0.8 = \\u00a340, so they actually pay \\u00a340 per night if they book early. With a \\u00a3500 budget, they can stay for 500 \\u00f7 40 = 12.5 nights. Rounding down, as partial nights are not considered, gives them 12 nights. Without a discount, they could stay for 500 \\u00f7 50 = 10 nights. So, they can stay 2 additional nights with the early booking discount. The student misunderstood the percentage discount and calculated it incorrectly, ending up with a wrong approximation of 7 nights.\\nThis part scores 0 marks.\\n\\nAdding up: 0 (a)(i) + 0 (a)(ii) + 1 (a)(iii) + 0 (b) = 1\\n\\n1\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737725076, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 491, \"prompt_tokens\": 897, \"total_tokens\": 1388, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.007152500000000001}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\nYour task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question,\\nfrom 0 up to a maximum of 8 marks.\\n\\nThe question is:\\n\\n17\\u202f\\u202fIn this row of boxes, you start with 5 and 7.\\n\\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502 5 \\u2502 7 \\u2502    \\u2502    \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518\\n\\nYou add 5 and 7 to get 12 to go in the third box.  \\nYou add 7 and 12 to get 19 to go in the fourth box.  \\nYou add 12 and 19 to get 31 to go in the fifth box.\\n\\n5\\u20037\\u200312\\u200319\\u200331\\n\\nComplete these rows of boxes using the rule shown above:\\n\\n(a)  \\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502 4 \\u2502 6 \\u2502    \\u2502    \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518  \\n[1]\\n\\n(b)  \\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502    \\u2502    \\u2502 34 \\u2502 55 \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518  \\n[2]\\n\\n(c) Complete this row of boxes, writing your expressions in their simplest form:\\n\\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502 a \\u2502 b \\u2502    \\u2502    \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518  \\n[2]\\n\\n(d) Use your answer to (c) to help you fill in the missing numbers in this row of boxes:\\n\\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502 6 \\u2502    \\u2502    \\u2502 57 \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518  \\n[3]\\n\\n\\nTheir answer to this question is:\\n\\n(a) Starting with 4 and 6: 4 + 6 = 10, then 6 + 10 = 16, and 10 + 16 = 26.

The student noted they think they can get approximately 7 nights with the discount while ordinary rate for 10 nights is possible, which shows a fundamental misunderstanding.\\n- Points: 0 marks because the approach makes a major arithmetic mistake and doesn't demonstrate correct workings or logic.\\n\\nOverall, the responses demonstrate a lack of understanding of the permutations, probabilities, and arithmetic operations required for this task.\\n\\nFinal total marks: \\n\\n0\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737727831, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 504, \"prompt_tokens\": 1699, \"total_tokens\": 2203, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.0092875}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\nYour task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question,\\nfrom 0 up to a maximum of 8 marks.\\n\\nThe question is:\\n\\n17\\u202f\\u202fIn this row of boxes, you start with 5 and 7.\\n\\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502 5 \\u2502 7 \\u2502    \\u2502    \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518\\n\\nYou add 5 and 7 to get 12 to go in the third box.  \\nYou add 7 and 12 to get 19 to go in the fourth box.  \\nYou add 12 and 19 to get 31 to go in the fifth box.\\n\\n5\\u20037\\u200312\\u200319\\u200331\\n\\nComplete these rows of boxes using the rule shown above:\\n\\n(a)  \\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502 4 \\u2502 6 \\u2502    \\u2502    \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518  \\n[1]\\n\\n(b)  \\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502    \\u2502    \\u2502 34 \\u2502 55 \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518  \\n[2]\\n\\n(c) Complete this row of boxes, writing your expressions in their simplest form:\\n\\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502 a \\u2502 b \\u2502    \\u2502    \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518  \\n[2]\\n\\n(d) Use your answer to (c) to help you fill in the missing numbers in this row of boxes:\\n\\n \\u250c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u252c\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2510\\n \\u2502 6 \\u2502    \\u2502    \\u2502 57 \\u2502\\n \\u2514\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2534\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2500\\u2518  \\n[3]\\n\\n\\nThe markscheme for the question is:\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"a\\\": \\\"Answer: 10, 16, 26\\\\nMarks: 1\\\\nPart marks and guidance:\\\\n\\\\u2022 1 AO1.3a\\\",\\n    \\\"b\\\": \\\"Answer: 8, 13, 21\\\\nMarks: 2\\\\nPart marks and guidance:\\\\n\\\\u2022 1 AO1.3a\\\\n\\\\u2022 1 AO3.1a\\\\n  M1 for one correct subtraction of two boxes\\\",\\n    \\\"c\\\": \\\"Answer: a + b, a + 2b, 2a + 3b\\\\nMarks: 2\\\\nPart marks and guidance:\\\\n\\\\u2022 2 AO1.3a\\\\n  M1 for two expressions correct\\\",\\n    \\\"d\\\": \\\"Answer: 15, 21, 36\\\\nMarks: 3\\\\nPart marks and guidance:\\\\n\\\\u2022 1 AO1.3a\\\\n\\\\u2022 2 AO2.1a\\\\n  M1 for their \\\\u20182a + 3b\\\\u2019 = 57\\\\n  M1 for substituting a = 6 into their final expression and solving for b\\\"\\n}\\n\\n\\nTheir answer to this question is:\\n\\n(a) Starting with 4 and 6: 4 + 6 = 10, then 6 + 10 = 16, and 10 + 16 = 26.

Let\\u2019s unravel it:\\n- They let the unknowns be x, y, z correctly.\\n- They correctly utilized the pattern starting from 6 and ending at 57, which led to the correct result of 6, 15, 21, 36, 57. This solution shows proper understanding and execution, but does not utilize the expressions from part (c).\\n\\nEven though no explicit substitution from (c) is shown, due to successfully establishing and solving using the addition pattern, this suggests mastery of the task. Since they correctly found the numbers, I would award them 2 of the 3 marks, lacking only the explicit link to the algebra expressions.\\n\\nIn total, they earned:\\n- 1 mark for (a)\\n- 2 marks for (b)\\n- 0 marks for (c)\\n- 2 marks for (d)\\n\\nThis sums up to 5 marks out of a possible 8 marks.\\n\\n5\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737727844, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 499, \"prompt_tokens\": 1957, \"total_tokens\": 2456, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.009882499999999999}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\nYour task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question,\\nfrom 0 up to a maximum of 6 marks.\\n\\nThe question is:\\n\\n19) Here are the interest rates for two accounts:\\n\\nAccount A  \\n\\u2022 Interest: 3% per year compound interest.  \\n\\u2022 No withdrawals until the end of three years.\\n\\nAccount B  \\n\\u2022 Interest: 4% for the first year, 3% for the second year, and 2% for the third year.  \\n\\u2022 Withdrawals allowed at any time.\\n\\nDerrick has \\u00a310\\u202f000 he wants to invest.\\n\\n(a) Calculate which account would give him most money if he invests his money for 3 years.  \\n   Give the difference in the interest to the nearest penny.  \\n   You must show your working.\\n\\n   (a) Account \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026 by \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026 p [5]\\n\\n(b) Explain why he might not want to use Account A.  \\n\\n   \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026  \\n   \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026 [1]\\n\\n\\nThe markscheme for the question is:\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"a\\\": \\\"Answer:\\\\n(Account) A (by) 103[p] with correct working\\\\n\\\\nMarks: 5\\\\n(3 AO1.3b, 1 AO3.1d, 1 AO3.3)\\\\n\\\\nMarking guidance:\\\\n\\\\u2022 M2 for [10 000 \\\\u00d7] 1.03\\\\u00b3 implied by 10 927.27, or M1 for 10 300 and 10 609\\\\n\\\\nAND\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2022 M2 for [10 000 \\\\u00d7] 1.04 \\\\u00d7 1.03 \\\\u00d7 1.02 implied by 10 926.24, or M1 for 10 400 and 10 712\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2022 If 0, 1 or 2 scored, instead award SC3 for A by 103[p] with no working or insufficient working\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Correct working\\\\\\\" requires evidence of at M2M2.\\\\nMay be done in stages.\\\",\\n    \\\"b\\\": \\\"Answer:\\\\nHe may not want to leave it there for 3 years\\\\n\\\\nMarks: 1\\\\n(1 AO2.3a)\\\\n\\\\nMarking guidance:\\\\nAccept any valid reason.\\\"\\n}\\n\\n\\nTheir answer to this question is:\\n\\n(a) For Account A, I just add 3% each year for three years: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9%.

Therefore, they were not awarded this mark.\\n\\n3. **Cost of One 10-litre Can (M1):**  \\n   - This M1 requires a detailed calculation using the determined costs per litre:\\n     - Correct method: \\\\(4 \\\\text{ litres} \\\\times \\u00a38 + 6 \\\\text{ litres} \\\\times \\u00a30.50 = \\u00a332 + \\u00a33 = \\u00a335\\\\)\\n   - The student did not provide this calculation and thus does not earn this mark.\\n\\n4. **Profit Calculation (M1):**  \\n   - The profit calculation involves subtracting the correct total cost (\\u00a335 from their calculations) from the selling price (\\u00a360):\\n     - Correct method: \\\\(\\u00a360 - \\u00a335 = \\u00a325\\\\)\\n   - The student's incorrect assumption of \\u00a310 as the total cost led to an inaccurate profit of \\u00a350. Therefore, they do not earn this mark.\\n\\n5. **Answer 25 with Insufficient Working (SC2):**  \\n   - The student did not conclude with the correct answer of 25 for the profit, nor did they show sufficient working that aligns with the mark scheme. Therefore, the special credit (SC2) cannot be awarded.\\n\\nBased on this breakdown:\\n\\n- Award 1 mark for the correct use of the ratio to calculate red and white paint volumes.\\n- No further marks can be awarded due to the incorrect cost calculations and resulting incorrect profit conclusion.\\n\\nThus, the final score is:\\n\\n1\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737727885, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 482, \"prompt_tokens\": 1179, \"total_tokens\": 1661, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.0077675}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\nYour task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question,\\nfrom 0 up to a maximum of 3 marks.\\n\\nThe question is:\\n\\n7.

The numbers given are 0.34, 1/3, and 3.5%. Let's go through the steps to determine how the student's answer should be marked:\\n\\n1. **Convert the Numbers to a Common Format:**\\n   - To compare these values, it's convenient to convert them all to decimals. \\n   - 0.34 is already in decimal form.\\n   - 1/3 as a decimal is approximately 0.3333.\\n   - 3.5% as a decimal is 0.035 (since \\\"percent\\\" means per hundred and 3.5% is 3.5/100).\\n\\n2. **Determine the Correct Order:**\\n   - Converting all to decimals gives: 0.035 (3.5%), 0.3333 (1/3), and 0.34.\\n   - In increasing order: 0.035, 0.3333, 0.34.\\n\\n3. **Interpret the Mark Scheme:**\\n   - The correct answer according to the mark scheme is: 3.5%, 1/3, 0.34.\\n   - Marks are awarded as follows:\\n     - **B1** for identifying or recognizing 1/3 as 0.3333... or 33...%, \\n     - **B1** for recognizing 0.34 as 34%, \\n     - **B1** for converting 3.5% to 0.035,\\n     - **SC1** can be given for ordering as: 1/3, 0.34, 3.5%.\\n\\n4. **Evaluate the Student's Answer:**\\n   - The student's answer is: 1/3, 0.34, 3.5%.\\n   - This order is precisely outlined in the mark scheme under the Special Case (SC1). According to the mark scheme, this order merits SC1, which corresponds to 1 mark.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the criteria laid out in the mark scheme, the student should receive 1 mark for the given answer because they have provided the special case order of 1/3, 0.34, 3.5%.\\n\\n1\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737727905, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 463, \"prompt_tokens\": 623, \"total_tokens\": 1086, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.006187499999999999}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\nYour task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question,\\nfrom 0 up to a maximum of 5 marks.\\n\\nThe question is:\\n\\n14  The value of a car \\u00a3V is given by  \\n    V = 20\\u202f000 \\u00d7 0.9^t  \\nwhere t is the age of the car in complete years.  \\n\\n(a)  Write down the value of V when t = 0.  \\n    (a) \\u00a3 \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026 [1]  \\n\\n(b)  What is the value of V when t = 3?  \\n    (b) \\u00a3 \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026 [2]  \\n\\n(c)  After how many complete years will the car\\u2019s value drop below \\u00a310\\u202f000?  \\n    (c) \\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026 [2]\\n\\n\\nThe markscheme for the question is:\\n\\n{\\n    \\\"a\\\": \\\"Answer: \\\\u00a320\\\\u202f000\\\\n\\\\nMarks: 1\\\\n\\\\nMark scheme:\\\\n\\\\u2022 1 AO1.3a\\\",\\n    \\\"b\\\": \\\"Answer: \\\\u00a314\\\\u202f580 or \\\\u00a314\\\\u202f600\\\\n\\\\nMarks: 2\\\\n\\\\nMark scheme:\\\\n\\\\u2022 2 AO1.3a\\\\n\\\\u2022 M1 for 20\\\\u202f000 \\\\u00d7 0.9\\\\u00b3\\\",\\n    \\\"c\\\": \\\"Answer: 7 years\\\\n\\\\nMarks: 2\\\\n\\\\nMark scheme:\\\\n\\\\u2022 1 AO1.3a\\\\n\\\\u2022 1 AO3.1c\\\\n\\\\u2022 M1 for 2 trials shown\\\"\\n}\\n\\n\\nTheir answer to this question is:\\n\\n(a) \\u00a320,000\\n(b) \\u00a315,000\\n(c) 5 years\\n\\nPlease think carefully, and state your reasoning step-by-step, \\nwith lots of detail on your reasons for awaring each mark.\\n\\n\\nAs the very final part of your response, simply provide the number of marks on a\\n*new line*, without any additional formatting.

The student does not attempt this step and assumes the cost instead.\\n   - Because of this, the second **M1** mark for determining the cost per litre of either red paint (\\u00a38/litre) or white paint (\\u00a30.50/litre) is not awarded.\\n\\n3. **Calculation of Total Cost**:\\n   - The student assumed the total cost of 4 litres of red and 6 litres of white was \\u00a310 incorrectly, which deviates from calculating the actual cost of \\\\(4 \\\\times 8 + 6 \\\\times 0.5 = 35\\\\).\\n   - Thus, the third **M1** mark for correctly calculating the total cost of a 10-litre can is not awarded either.

You should ignore \\n leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 \\n would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen \\nanywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an \\nacceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by \\nthe instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks\\nunless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(ii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but the answer line is blank, allow full marks. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the\\ncorrect answer.\\n\\n(iii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but a completely different answer is seen on the answer line, then accuracy marks for\\nthe answer are lost.

Therefore M0 A1 cannot be awarded.\\nB marks are independent of M (method) marks and are for a correct final answer, a partially correct answer, or a correct intermediate stage.\\nSC marks are for special cases that are worthy of some credit.\\n\\n2.\\nUnless the answer and marks columns of the mark scheme specify M and A marks etc, or the mark scheme is \\u2018banded\\u2019, then if the correct\\nanswer is clearly given and is not from wrong working full marks should be awarded.\\n\\nDo not award the marks if the answer was obtained from an incorrect method, i.e. incorrect working is seen and the correct answer clearly follows\\nfrom it.\\n\\n3.\\nWhere follow through (FT) is indicated in the mark scheme, marks can be awarded where the candidate\\u2019s work follows correctly from a\\nprevious answer whether or not it was correct.\\n\\nFigures or expressions that are being followed through are sometimes encompassed by single quotation marks after the word their for clarity,\\ne.g. FT 180 \\u00d7 (their \\u201837\\u2019 + 16), or FT 300 \\u2013 \\uf0d6(their \\u201852 + 72\\u2019). Answers to part questions which are being followed through are indicated by e.g. FT\\n3 \\u00d7 their (a).\\n\\nFor questions with FT available you must ensure that you refer back to the relevant previous answer. You may find it easier to mark these\\nquestions candidate by candidate rather than question by question.\\n\\n4.\\nWhere dependent (dep) marks are indicated in the mark scheme, you must check that the candidate has met all the criteria specified for the\\nmark to be awarded.\\n\\n5.\\nThe following abbreviations are commonly found in GCSE Mathematics mark schemes.\\n- **figs 237**, for example, means any answer with only these digits. You should ignore \\n leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 \\n would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen \\nanywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an \\nacceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by \\nthe instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks\\nunless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.
