Answers to part questions which are being followed through are indicated by e.g. FT 3 \\u00d7 their (a).\\n\\nFor questions with FT available you must ensure that you refer back to the relevant previous answer.

You should ignore leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen anywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an acceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by the instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks unless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.

You should ignore leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen anywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an acceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by the instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks unless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(ii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but the answer line is blank, allow full marks. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(iii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but a completely different answer is seen on the answer line, then accuracy marks for the answer are lost. Method marks could still be awarded. Use the M0, M1, M2 annotations as appropriate and place the annotation \\uf0fb next to the wrong answer.\\n\\n8.\\nIn questions with a final answer line:\\n\\n(i)If one answer is provided on the answer line, mark the method that leads to that answer.\\n\\n(ii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is a single method provided, award method marks only.\\n\\n(iii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is more than one method provided, award zero marks for the question unless the candidate has clearly indicated which method is to be marked.\\n\\n9.\\nIn questions with no final answer line:\\n\\n(i)If a single response is provided, mark as usual.\\n\\n(ii)If more than one response is provided, award zero marks for the question unless the candidate has clearly indicated which response is to be marked.\\n\\n10.\\nWhen the data of a question is consistently misread in such a way as not to alter the nature or difficulty of the question, please follow the candidate\\u2019s work and allow follow through for **A** and **B** marks. Deduct 1 mark from any **A** or **B** marks earned and record this by using the MR annotation. **M** marks are not deducted for misreads.\\n\\n11.\\nUnless the question asks for an answer to a specific degree of accuracy, always mark at the greatest number of significant figures even if this is rounded or truncated on the answer line. For example, an answer in the mark scheme is 15 75, which is seen in the working. The candidate then rounds or truncates this to 15.8, 15 or 16 on the answer line. Allow full marks for the 15.75.\\n\\n12.\\nRanges of answers given in the mark scheme are always inclusive.\\n\\n13.\\nFor methods not provided for in the mark scheme give as far as possible equivalent marks for equivalent work.\\n\\n14.\\nAnything in the mark scheme which is in square brackets [\\u2026] is not required for the mark to be earned, but if present it must be correct.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe question you need to mark is:\\n\\n10 The graph shows the number of ice creams sold in a shop each day against the temperature at midday that day.\\n\\n(a) (i) Describe the relationship between the temperature at midday and the number of ice creams sold.

from 0 up to a maximum of 8 marks.\\n\\nThe general marking guidelines (relevant for all questions) are as follows:\\n\\n----\\n\\n1.\\nM marks are for using a correct method and are not lost for purely numerical errors.\\nA marks are for an accurate answer and depend on preceding M (method) marks. Therefore M0 A1 cannot be awarded.\\nB marks are independent of M (method) marks and are for a correct final answer, a partially correct answer, or a correct intermediate stage.\\nSC marks are for special cases that are worthy of some credit.\\n\\n2.\\nUnless the answer and marks columns of the mark scheme specify M and A marks etc, or the mark scheme is \\u2018banded\\u2019, then if the correct answer is clearly given and is not from wrong working full marks should be awarded.\\n\\nDo not award the marks if the answer was obtained from an incorrect method, i.e. incorrect working is seen and the correct answer clearly follows from it.\\n\\n3.\\nWhere follow through (FT) is indicated in the mark scheme, marks can be awarded where the candidate\\u2019s work follows correctly from a previous answer whether or not it was correct.\\n\\nFigures or expressions that are being followed through are sometimes encompassed by single quotation marks after the word their for clarity, e.g. FT 180 \\u00d7 (their \\u201837\\u2019 + 16), or FT 300 \\u2013 \\uf0d6(their \\u201852 + 72\\u2019). Answers to part questions which are being followed through are indicated by e.g. FT 3 \\u00d7 their (a).\\n\\nFor questions with FT available you must ensure that you refer back to the relevant previous answer. You may find it easier to mark these questions candidate by candidate rather than question by question.\\n\\n4.\\nWhere dependent (dep) marks are indicated in the mark scheme, you must check that the candidate has met all the criteria specified for the mark to be awarded.\\n\\n5.\\nThe following abbreviations are commonly found in GCSE Mathematics mark schemes.\\n- **figs 237**, for example, means any answer with only these digits. You should ignore leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen anywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an acceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by the instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks unless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(ii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but the answer line is blank, allow full marks. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(iii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but a completely different answer is seen on the answer line, then accuracy marks for the answer are lost. Method marks could still be awarded. Use the M0, M1, M2 annotations as appropriate and place the annotation \\uf0fb next to the wrong answer.\\n\\n8.\\nIn questions with a final answer line:\\n\\n(i)If one answer is provided on the answer line, mark the method that leads to that answer.\\n\\n(ii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is a single method provided, award method marks only.\\n\\n(iii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is more than one method provided, award zero marks for the question unless the candidate has clearly indicated which method is to be marked.\\n\\n9.\\nIn questions with no final answer line:\\n\\n(i)If a single response is provided, mark as usual.\\n\\n(ii)If more than one response is provided, award zero marks for the question unless the candidate has clearly indicated which response is to be marked.\\n\\n10.\\nWhen the data of a question is consistently misread in such a way as not to alter the nature or difficulty of the question, please follow the candidate\\u2019s work and allow follow through for **A** and **B** marks. Deduct 1 mark from any **A** or **B** marks earned and record this by using the MR annotation. **M** marks are not deducted for misreads.\\n\\n11.\\nUnless the question asks for an answer to a specific degree of accuracy, always mark at the greatest number of significant figures even if this is rounded or truncated on the answer line. For example, an answer in the mark scheme is 15 75, which is seen in the working. The candidate then rounds or truncates this to 15.8, 15 or 16 on the answer line. Allow full marks for the 15.75.\\n\\n12.\\nRanges of answers given in the mark scheme are always inclusive.\\n\\n13.\\nFor methods not provided for in the mark scheme give as far as possible equivalent marks for equivalent work.\\n\\n14.\\nAnything in the mark scheme which is in square brackets [\\u2026] is not required for the mark to be earned, but if present it must be correct.\\n\\n15.\\nWhen students are explaining something in their answer, then their explanation must make *exactly* the same point(s) as are made in the markscheme. The wording can be slightly different, but the underlying observations/reasons must be *identical*, unless otherwise stated *explicitly* in the markscheme.\\n\\n----\\n\\n\\nThe question you need to mark is:\\n\\n10 The graph shows the number of ice creams sold in a shop each day against the temperature at midday that day.\\n\\n(a) (i) Describe the relationship between the temperature at midday and the number of ice creams sold.

Therefore M0 A1 cannot be awarded.\\nB marks are independent of M (method) marks and are for a correct final answer, a partially correct answer, or a correct intermediate stage.\\nSC marks are for special cases that are worthy of some credit.\\n\\n2.\\nUnless the answer and marks columns of the mark scheme specify M and A marks etc, or the mark scheme is \\u2018banded\\u2019, then if the correct answer is clearly given and is not from wrong working full marks should be awarded.\\n\\nDo not award the marks if the answer was obtained from an incorrect method, i.e. incorrect working is seen and the correct answer clearly follows from it.\\n\\n3.\\nWhere follow through (FT) is indicated in the mark scheme, marks can be awarded where the candidate\\u2019s work follows correctly from a previous answer whether or not it was correct.\\n\\nFigures or expressions that are being followed through are sometimes encompassed by single quotation marks after the word their for clarity, e.g. FT 180 \\u00d7 (their \\u201837\\u2019 + 16), or FT 300 \\u2013 \\uf0d6(their \\u201852 + 72\\u2019). Answers to part questions which are being followed through are indicated by e.g. FT 3 \\u00d7 their (a).\\n\\nFor questions with FT available you must ensure that you refer back to the relevant previous answer. You may find it easier to mark these questions candidate by candidate rather than question by question.\\n\\n4.\\nWhere dependent (dep) marks are indicated in the mark scheme, you must check that the candidate has met all the criteria specified for the mark to be awarded.\\n\\n5.\\nThe following abbreviations are commonly found in GCSE Mathematics mark schemes.\\n- **figs 237**, for example, means any answer with only these digits. You should ignore leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen anywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an acceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by the instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks unless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.

Therefore M0 A1 cannot be awarded.\\nB marks are independent of M (method) marks and are for a correct final answer, a partially correct answer, or a correct intermediate stage.\\nSC marks are for special cases that are worthy of some credit.\\n\\n2.\\nUnless the answer and marks columns of the mark scheme specify M and A marks etc, or the mark scheme is \\u2018banded\\u2019, then if the correct answer is clearly given and is not from wrong working full marks should be awarded.\\n\\nDo not award the marks if the answer was obtained from an incorrect method, i.e. incorrect working is seen and the correct answer clearly follows from it.\\n\\n3.\\nWhere follow through (FT) is indicated in the mark scheme, marks can be awarded where the candidate\\u2019s work follows correctly from a previous answer whether or not it was correct.\\n\\nFigures or expressions that are being followed through are sometimes encompassed by single quotation marks after the word their for clarity, e.g. FT 180 \\u00d7 (their \\u201837\\u2019 + 16), or FT 300 \\u2013 \\uf0d6(their \\u201852 + 72\\u2019). Answers to part questions which are being followed through are indicated by e.g. FT 3 \\u00d7 their (a).\\n\\nFor questions with FT available you must ensure that you refer back to the relevant previous answer. You may find it easier to mark these questions candidate by candidate rather than question by question.\\n\\n4.\\nWhere dependent (dep) marks are indicated in the mark scheme, you must check that the candidate has met all the criteria specified for the mark to be awarded.\\n\\n5.\\nThe following abbreviations are commonly found in GCSE Mathematics mark schemes.\\n- **figs 237**, for example, means any answer with only these digits. You should ignore leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen anywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an acceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by the instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks unless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(ii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but the answer line is blank, allow full marks. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(iii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but a completely different answer is seen on the answer line, then accuracy marks for the answer are lost. Method marks could still be awarded. Use the M0, M1, M2 annotations as appropriate and place the annotation \\uf0fb next to the wrong answer.\\n\\n8.\\nIn questions with a final answer line:\\n\\n(i)If one answer is provided on the answer line, mark the method that leads to that answer.\\n\\n(ii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is a single method provided, award method marks only.\\n\\n(iii)If more than one answer is provided on the answer line and there is more than one method provided, award zero marks for the question unless the candidate has clearly indicated which method is to be marked.\\n\\n9.\\nIn questions with no final answer line:\\n\\n(i)If a single response is provided, mark as usual.\\n\\n(ii)If more than one response is provided, award zero marks for the question unless the candidate has clearly indicated which response is to be marked.\\n\\n10.\\nWhen the data of a question is consistently misread in such a way as not to alter the nature or difficulty of the question, please follow the candidate\\u2019s work and allow follow through for **A** and **B** marks. Deduct 1 mark from any **A** or **B** marks earned and record this by using the MR annotation. **M** marks are not deducted for misreads.\\n\\n11.\\nUnless the question asks for an answer to a specific degree of accuracy, always mark at the greatest number of significant figures even if this is rounded or truncated on the answer line. For example, an answer in the mark scheme is 15 75, which is seen in the working. The candidate then rounds or truncates this to 15.8, 15 or 16 on the answer line. Allow full marks for the 15.75.\\n\\n12.\\nRanges of answers given in the mark scheme are always inclusive.\\n\\n13.\\nFor methods not provided for in the mark scheme give as far as possible equivalent marks for equivalent work.\\n\\n14.\\nAnything in the mark scheme which is in square brackets [\\u2026] is not required for the mark to be earned, but if present it must be correct.\\n\\n15.\\nWhen students are explaining something in their answer, then their explanation must make *exactly* the same point(s) as are made in the markscheme.

Therefore M0 A1 cannot be awarded.\\nB marks are independent of M (method) marks and are for a correct final answer, a partially correct answer, or a correct intermediate stage.\\nSC marks are for special cases that are worthy of some credit.\\n\\n2.\\nUnless the answer and marks columns of the mark scheme specify M and A marks etc, or the mark scheme is \\u2018banded\\u2019, then if the correct answer is clearly given and is not from wrong working full marks should be awarded.\\n\\nDo not award the marks if the answer was obtained from an incorrect method, i.e. incorrect working is seen and the correct answer clearly follows from it.\\n\\n3.\\nWhere follow through (FT) is indicated in the mark scheme, marks can be awarded where the candidate\\u2019s work follows correctly from a previous answer whether or not it was correct.\\n\\nFigures or expressions that are being followed through are sometimes encompassed by single quotation marks after the word their for clarity, e.g. FT 180 \\u00d7 (their \\u201837\\u2019 + 16), or FT 300 \\u2013 \\uf0d6(their \\u201852 + 72\\u2019). Answers to part questions which are being followed through are indicated by e.g. FT 3 \\u00d7 their (a).\\n\\nFor questions with FT available you must ensure that you refer back to the relevant previous answer. You may find it easier to mark these questions candidate by candidate rather than question by question.\\n\\n4.\\nWhere dependent (dep) marks are indicated in the mark scheme, you must check that the candidate has met all the criteria specified for the mark to be awarded.\\n\\n5.\\nThe following abbreviations are commonly found in GCSE Mathematics mark schemes.\\n- **figs 237**, for example, means any answer with only these digits. You should ignore leading or trailing zeros and any decimal point e.g. 237000, 2.37, 2.370, 0.00237 would be acceptable but 23070 or 2374 would not.\\n- **isw** means **ignore subsequent working** after correct answer obtained and applies as a default.\\n- **nfww** means not from wrong working.\\n- **oe** means **or equivalent**.\\n- **rot** means **rounded or truncated**.\\n- **seen** means that you should award the mark if that number/expression is seen anywhere in the answer space, including the answer line, even if it is not in the method leading to the final answer\\n- **soi** means seen or implied.\\n\\n6.\\nIn questions with no final answer line, make no deductions for wrong work after an acceptable answer (ie **isw**) unless the mark scheme says otherwise, indicated by the instruction \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019.\\n\\n7.\\nIn questions with a final answer line following working space:\\n\\n(i)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working and the answer given on the answer line is a clear transcription error allow full marks unless the mark scheme says \\u2018mark final answer\\u2019. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(ii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but the answer line is blank, allow full marks. Place the annotation \\u2713 next to the correct answer.\\n\\n(iii)If the correct answer is seen in the body of working but a completely different answer is seen on the answer line, then accuracy marks for the answer are lost. Method marks could still be awarded.

Deduct 1 mark from any **A** or **B** marks earned and record this by using the MR annotation. **M** marks are not deducted for misreads.\\n\\n11.\\nUnless the question asks for an answer to a specific degree of accuracy, always mark at the greatest number of significant figures even if this is rounded or truncated on the answer line. For example, an answer in the mark scheme is 15 75, which is seen in the working. The candidate then rounds or truncates this to 15.8, 15 or 16 on the answer line. Allow full marks for the 15.75.\\n\\n12.\\nRanges of answers given in the mark scheme are always inclusive.\\n\\n13.\\nFor methods not provided for in the mark scheme give as far as possible equivalent marks for equivalent work.\\n\\n14.\\nAnything in the mark scheme which is in square brackets [\\u2026] is not required for the mark to be earned, but if present it must be correct.\\n\\n15.\\nWhen students are explaining something in their answer, then their explanation must make *exactly* the same point(s) as are made in the markscheme.
