title: 'Traffic'
---

In order to monitor our production traffic, let's first open the Unify console, and
click on "Interfaces" to build our traffic monitoring interface.

As per the
[notebook]()
simulating our usage, the project is called `"EdTech"`.

Let's select this project from the dropdown at the top. If you don't see the project,
then make sure you've set up your API key in the
[notebook]()
correctly.

Now we've selected the `"EdTech"` project, let's add a table to the interface so we can
look at the raw data:

By default, the *most recent* logs will be shown at the top of the screen.

We're only interested in the exam question testing for now, so let's set the
context of the table as "Testing" to remove all of the irrelevant information:

Let's now create a plot to monitor how the traffic is changing over time. We create a
new plot tile, select the bar chart type, select timestamp for the `x` axis, and then
select the number of buckets we'd like to use. Let's go with 50 buckets.

Let's now turn on streaming mode, such that the logs in the table and all
corresponding plots are automatically updated whenever new data is available.

The plot and table will continue to grow unbounded in the current configuration. Let's
add a filter to the timestamp column, such that we're only retrieving logs from the
past 5 minutes.

If we want to look at traffic for a particular student, we can simply filter for
this student in the table, and the plot will also be updated.

Similarly, we can filter for a questions from a particular past paper, or anything
else.

If we'd like to view several of these plots at the same time, then we can simply
make a clone of the table (or create a new one), make the filtering changes to this new
table, and then create another plot which references this second table.

If you don't need to see the table on screen, then you can simply hide the tile, or
add the table tiles on a separate tab which is just for data processing.

If you're happy with your configuration, you can save it as an interface for loading
later. Let's save this interface as `"Traffic"`. We can then close the browser, and
when we open up the `"EdTech"` project, we can select our `"Traffic"` interface from
the list of available project interfaces.

This example has just been a *very* simple taster of the kinds of things you can
quickly hack together in the frontend for logging, in this case focusing on the
traffic.

In the next example, we'll look at how interfaces can be used to spot more general
patterns and trends in the production data. See you there!
