## 🔍 Method Marks Confusion

All of the prior failures now seem to have been resolved,
but we have a new regression for **Example 215 (b)**.
Let's take a look.

**Example 215 (b)**

❓ Question [2 Marks]:

> Complete these rows of boxes using the rule shown above.

📝 Student's Answer:

> The missing boxes are 8, 13, and 21, making the sequence 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.

☑️ Markscheme:

> Answer: 8, 13, 21
Marks: 2
Guidance:
M1 for one correct subtraction of two boxes

✅ Correct Marks [2/2] Rationale:

> Here, we deduce the missing numbers by working backwards from 34 and 55 or by applying the same rule forward. According to the markscheme (2 marks), we get full credit for the fully correct set of missing numbers, with one method mark (M1) for a correct subtraction and a final accuracy mark (A1) for the correct sequence.

🤖 Predicted Marks [0/2] Rationale:

> The candidate's final numerical answer is correct (the missing boxes are 8, 13, and 21), matching the answer in the mark scheme. However, the mark scheme specifically awards M1 for showing a correct subtraction (i.e. working that reverses the addition rule), which is a required part of the method. Since the candidate only provided the final answer without demonstrating any subtraction (or any equivalent working) to show the method, no evidence is provided to award the M1 mark. As A marks (for an accurate answer) depend on obtaining the method mark, no further marks can be awarded. Therefore, despite the correct final answer, the lack of required working means no marks should be awarded.

This is an interesting failure mode.
The justification for the "correct" (ground truth) marks is actually wrong.
There is no **A1** mark for this question (which *would* depend on a method mark).
This is irrelevant in terms of the agent failure (the agent doesn't know the correct marks or rationale),
but it's still an interesting observsation regarding our "ground truth" data.

Interestingly,
the agent has made the *same mistake* as occurs in the "ground truth" rationale.
Our agent presumes the existence of an **A** mark where none were stated.
It seems like the agent doesn't understand that correct answers should always earn full marks,
unless otherwise explicitly stated.
**M1** marks are not necessary to achieve full marks in such cases,
unless an **A** mark is specifically referenced.

## 🔀 Clarify Method + Answer Marks

Let's try to fully clarify these points for the sub-question agent,
and re-run the evals.

``` {1-9}
output_response_explanation = """
You should populate the `reasoning` field with your general thoughts on each individual mark identified in the markscheme, and also a decision as to whether each of these mark should be awarded.

If you deem that a mark *should* be awarded (such SC1, B1, A1 etc.), then it is worth as many marks as appear in the mark type itself (SC1, B1, and A1 are therefore worth 1 mark each, A2 is worth 2 marks etc.). However, these marks are not *necessarily* cumulative with regards to the total marks to award for this sub-question, and some may be irrelevant given the student's approach or answer.

More importantly, full marks should *always* be given for a fully correct answer, unless otherwise *explicitly* stated. For example, a correct answer without any method shown should still get *full marks*, despite the M1 criteria not being met. The only exception to this is explicitly referenced A marks, which do depend on the preceding M marks being awarded.

Finally, after you've given it a lot of thought, you should put the total number of marks to award for this sub-question in the `marks` field.
"""
```

## 🧪 Rerun Tests

```python {2}
with unify.Experiment(
    "clarify_method_marks",
    overwrite=True,
), unify.Params(
    subq_system_message=subq_system_message,
    mark_system_message=mark_system_message,
    dataset="TestSet10",
    source=unify.get_source(),
):
    unify.map(
        evaluate,
        [
            dict(
                **d.entries,
                _subq_system_message=subq_system_message,
                _mark_system_message=mark_system_message,
            )
            for d in test_set_10
        ],
        name="Evals",
    )
```

Let's take a look at the traces,
to ensure that the system message template has been implemented correctly,
and each LLM call has the template variables in the system message populated correctly.

<div
  style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: '56.25%', // 16:9 ratio
    height: 0,
  }}
>
  <iframe
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
      border: 'none'
    }}
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/{placeholder}"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>

It seems as though everything was implemented correctly,
and the per-LLM system messages look good ✅

Also,
we've finally got all 10/10 tests passing perfectly 🎉
