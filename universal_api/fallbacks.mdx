title: 'Fallbacks'
---

Sometimes individual providers have outages,
which can disrupt live workflows in production.
To combat this, you can set a list of fallback providers, models, endpoints, or even
entire fallback queries (if different models require unique system messages,
temperature etc.). Therefore, if one provider goes down or fails to respond for some
reason, the request will go to the next model on the list, and so on, until either the
request succeeds, or the end of the list is reached.

## Fallback Models, Providers, Endpoints and Regions

Lets assume you're deploying `claude-3-opus` for a production application, where
downtime would be detrimental for your users. You can set `anthropic` as your default
provider, with `aws-bedrock` as your *fallback provider* if Anthropic goes down or there
are rate limit issues, like so:

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "model": "claude-3-opus@anthropic->aws-bedrock",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello."}]
    }'
```

Of course, the same can be done via any of the
[query methods](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries)
([HTTP Requests](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#http-requests),
[Unify Python Package](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#unify-python-package),
[OpenAI Python Package](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#openai-python-package),
[OpenAI NodeJS Package](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#openai-nodejs-package),
by simply specifying the `model` argument in each case).
For example, in the
[Unify Python Package](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#unify-python-package)
it would simply look like this:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("claude-3-opus@anthropic->aws-bedrock")
response = client.generate("Hello.")
```

The same logic can also be applied to different models with the same provider,
for example maybe you're deploying `gemini-1.5-pro` on `vertex-ai`, but you hit
occasional rate limit issues, in which you want to fallback to `gemini-1.5-flash` as
your *fallback model*, again on `vertex-ai`. This can be specified like so:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("gemini-1.5-pro->gemini-1.5-flash@vertex-ai")
response = client.generate("Hello.")
```

Finally, you can also specify fallbacks for the *entire endpoint*.
For example, maybe you don't want to keep your users waiting, and so if the first
attempt to a larger model fails, then you just want to give them a response quickly:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("llama-3.1-405b-chat@together-ai->llama-3.1-70b-chat@groq")
response = client.generate("Hello.")
```

The Fallback logic can be composed arbitrarily across models, providers and endpoints.
For example, the following will attempt `llama-3.1-405b-chat` for a variety of providers
before falling back to `llama-3.1-70b-chat@groq` if they all fail:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("llama-3.1-405b-chat@together-ai->fireworks-ai->vertex-ai->llama-3.1-70b-chat@groq")
response = client.generate("Hello.")
```

As another example, the following will attempt `gemini-1.5-pro` and `gemini-1.5-flash`
with `vertex-ai`, then attempt `llama-3.1-405b-chat` with `together-ai` and
`fireworks-ai` if they fail, and then finally attempt `llama-3.1-70b-chat@groq`:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("gemini-1.5-pro->gemini-1.5-flash@vertex-ai->llama-3.1-405b-chat@together-ai->fireworks-ai->vertex-ai->llama-3.1-70b-chat@groq")
response = client.generate("Hello.")
```

For enterprise users deploying [on-prem](https://docs.unify.ai/on_prem),
you can also route across different *regions*.
For example, lets assume you are deploying `gemini-1.5-pro` on `us-east1`,
but sometimes hit rate limits. You can add a fallback to `us-west1` as follows:

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "model": "gemini-1.5-pro@vertex-ai",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello."}],
        "region": "us-east1->us-west1"
    }'
```

With the Python client, it would look as follows:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("gemini-1.5-pro@vertex-ai", region="us-east1->us-west1")
response = client.generate("Hello.")
```

If a fallback *region* is specified, then fallback models,
providers and endpoints **cannot** be specified as well.
Fallback regions are only compatible with individual endpoints.

## Fallback Queries

As mentioned above, fallbacks can also be specified for *entire queries*.
This is useful in cases where aspects of the prompt need to be handled in a
model-specific or provider-specific manner.

Taking the very first example again, lets assume you're deploying `claude-3-opus` for a
production application. You would like to use `aws-bedrock` to make use of credits on
your own account, but you want to use `anthropic` as a fallback. Your have your own API
key for bedrock (and so you'll be passing `"use_custom_keys": true` in the request),
but you don't have your own API key for Anthropic. This fallback logic can be specified
as follows:

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '[
          {
            "model": "claude-3-opus@aws-bedrock",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello."}],
            "use_custom_keys": true
          },
          {
            "model": "claude-3-opus@anthropic",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello."}]
          }
    ]'
```

Fallback queries can also be combined with fallback models, providers, and endpoints.
For example, the fallback logic below will attempt `claude-3-opus@aws-bedrock` with
custom API keys, then `vertex-ai` (again with custom API keys, to use your own GCP
credits), before finally falling back to `anthropic` if both fail:

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '[
          {
            "model": "claude-3-opus@aws-bedrock->vertex-ai",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello."}],
            "use_custom_keys": true
          },
          {
            "model": "claude-3-opus@anthropic",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello."}]
          }
    ]'
```

Currently, fallbacks across queries is not support in the
[Python SDK](https://github.com/unifyai/unify), but if this would be useful,
