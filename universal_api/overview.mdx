There’s an ever expanding ocean of models and providers, with new LLMs coming out all the
time 🌊
Each provider requires a unique API key, unique payment processing system, and unique
format for querying the API.
When testing out different models and providers, it can quickly become very cumbersome to
manage all of these nuances 🫠
