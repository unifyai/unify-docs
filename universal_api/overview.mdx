New LLM models come out all the time, with each provider requiring a unique API key, billing, and API standard.
It quickly becomes cumbersome trying to manage all of these nuances.

Our Universal API provides:

- A single, common interface for all models and providers üü¢
- One account, with one balance and one API key üîë
- Integrations for your own fine-tuned and/or local LLMs üñ•Ô∏è

To get started, just [sign up](https://console.unify.ai/), `pip install unifyai`, and make your first query:


```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("gpt-4o@openai", api_key="UNIFY_KEY")
client.generate("hello world!")
```

You can list all supported models, endpoints and providers like so:

```python
# all
unify.list_models()
unify.list_providers()
unify.list_endpoints()

# filtered
unify.list_models("openai")
unify.list_providers("llama-3-8b-chat")
unify.list_endpoints(provider="openai")
unify.list_endpoints(model="llama-3-8b-chat")
```

That's it, you now have all the power of **all LLMs** at your finger tips ‚ö°

With great power comes great responsibility ü¶∏
