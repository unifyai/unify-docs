title: 'Routing'
---

In the previous section, we introduced *fallbacks*, which enable you to specify what to
do in the case of outages.

However, you can also specify routing logic to directly *maximize LLM performance*,
whether that be be improving *cost*, *quality* or *speed*. First, we outline the
[Base Metrics](#base-metrics) which can be optimized over, we then explain
[Meta Providers](#meta-providers) (models used with whatever provider optimizes a
given metric, based on the latest available benchmark data),
then [Thresholds](#thresholds) (specifying the permitted bounds for certain
metrics), then how routing can be performed across models (not only
providers) in [Model Routing](#model-routing), then how
[Custom Metrics](#custom-metrics) can be specified as a linear combination of the base
metrics, then how [The Search Space](#the-search-space) across models,
providers and endpoints can be defined, and finally we explain how
[Quality Prediction](#quality-prediction) works under the hood, and why training
your own router is the best option in order to maximize quality when routing over models
(explained in the subsequent sections!).

## Base Metrics

The *base metrics* and their permitted syntax when making chat completion queries,
are as follows:

- **Quality** (The quality of the generated response): `quality, q`
- **Time to First Token**: `time-to-first-token, ttft, t`
- **Inter Token Latency**: `inter-token-latency, itl, i`
- **Cost** ($ per million tokens based on the default [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) input:output ratio of 3:1): `cost, c`
- **Input Cost** ($ per million input tokens): `input-cost, ic`
- **Output Cost** ($ per million output tokens): `output-cost, oc`

## Meta Providers

Any of these *base metrics* can be specified in place of a *provider*,
when making chat completion requests. For example, lets assume we want to deploy
`claude-3-opus` with whichever provider has the fastest `inter-token-latency`,
based on the latest benchmark data. We can specify the following:

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "model": "claude-3-opus@inter-token-latency",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello."}]
    }'
```

As before, the same can be done via any of the
[query methods](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries)
([HTTP Requests](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#http-requests),
[Unify Python Package](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#unify-python-package),
[OpenAI Python Package](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#openai-python-package),
[OpenAI NodeJS Package](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#openai-nodejs-package),
again by simply specifying the `model` argument in each case).
For example, in the
[Unify Python Package](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/making_queries#unify-python-package)
it would simply look like this:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("claude-3-opus@inter-token-latency")
response = client.generate("Hello.")
```

To be more explicit, the prepending keywords `highest-` and `lowest-` can be specified.
When the keyword is omitted, it's assumed that the user wants the "best" option, which
is `highest-` for quality and `lowest-` for all other metrics.
The example above is equivalent to `claude-3-opus@lowest-inter-token-latency`.

## Thresholds

You can specify upper and/or lower bounds for any of these metrics using `<`, `>`, `<=`
and `>=` and separating each specification with `|` in the command. For example, the
following command will find the `llama-3.1-405b-chat` provider with the lowest inter
token latency (the fastest), provided that the endpoint is not more expensive that $5
per million tokens:

```shell
llama-3.1-405b-chat@inter-token-latency|c<5
```

The following will find the `llama-3.1-70b-chat` provider with the highest `quality`
(see explanation for how this is computed below).
Differences such as quantization can result in *different quality* for the *same model*.
The endpoint is also constrained to not be more expensive than `$0.8` per million tokens
in the *input*, not be more expensive than `$0.6` per million tokens in the *output*,
have an inter token latency faster than `20ms`, but not faster than `1ms`:

```shell
llama-3.1-70b-chat@quality|input-cost<=0.8|output-cost<=0.8|itl>1|itl<20
```

As explained above, any of the aliases defined above can be used interchangeably,
such as `i`, `itl` or `inter-token-latency` for the inter token latency.

## Model Routing

All of the examples above have assumed that there is a *single model* chosen,
and we're then just optimizing over the *provider* for that chosen model.

However, we can also include the model within the routing decision. To do so, we simply
specify the model as `router`. For example, the following will find the highest quality
endpoint (among *all* supported endpoints), which is cheaper than `$0.8` per million
input tokens, cheaper than `$0.6` per million output tokens, and has an inter token
latency faster than `20ms`:

```shell
router@quality|input-cost<0.8|output-cost<0.6|itl<20
```

## Custom Metrics

So far, we have only considered cases where we optimize for a *single base metric*, and
then constrain the search space for other metrics. However, you can also specify your
own *custom metric*, as a linear combination of the base metrics:

```shell
custom_metric = q_f*q - i_f*i - t_f*t - c_f*c
```

In words, this metric takes factors `{}_f` for each of the four base metrics:
`quality`, `inter-token-latency`, `time-to-first-token` and `cost`, and then computes
their linear combination, with the objective of *maximizing* `custom_metric`.

The `input-cost` and `output-cost` can also be specified independently,
if you'd rather use a *different ratio* than the default `3:1` that `c_f*c` uses
(as per the default ratio of [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/)):

```shell
custom_metric = q_f*q - i_f*i - t_f*t - ic_f*ic - oc_f*oc
```

With this form factor, controlling the custom metric is reduced to specifying the linear
factors `{}_f`. These linear factors can be specified as follows:

```shell
router@q:1|i:0.5|t:2|c:0.7
```

Factors which are left unspecified are assumed to be zero (their contribution to the
custom metric is ignored). For example, the following are aliases:

```shell
router@q:1|i:0.5 == router@q:1|i:0.5|t:0|c:0
```

Returning the the `input-cost` and `output-cost` ratio,
the following are also exact aliases:

```shell
router@c:1 == router@ic:0.75|oc:0.25
```

If `c` is specified, then neither `ic` nor `oc` can be specified in the command
(as per the example above, they *already are* fully specified via the `c` argument).

As before, any variant of the metric can be used to specify the factors:

```shell
router@q:1|i:0.5 == router@quality:1|inter-token-latency:0.5
```

The Meta Providers explained above are actually aliases to this same logic,
and under the hood they resolve to these factors:

```shell
llama-3.1-70b-chat@quality == llama-3.1-70b-chat@q:1 == llama-3.1-70b-chat@q:1|i:0|t:0|c:0
llama-3.1-70b-chat@itl == llama-3.1-70b-chat@i:1 == llama-3.1-70b-chat@q:0|i:1|t:0|c:0
```

For this reason, meta-providers cannot be specified alongside these factors.
Meta providers are basically convenient one-liners to specify *all four factors*.

Note that the units are **not normalized**. It's down to **you** to reason about
sensible values for the factors, based on the respective units:
`cost` in $ per M tokens, `itl` in ms, `ttft` in ms, and `quality` normalized to `0-1`.

When experimenting, you can retrieve the four metrics for any endpoint as follows:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/router/metric?endpoint=llama-3.1-405b-chat@together-ai' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY"
```

This will return a dictionary like below:

```shell
{
    "quality": 0.78
    "inter-token-latency": 15.67
    "time-to-first-token": 752.39
    "cost": 0.73
}
```

The custom metric can then be reasoned with very easily on the client side,
by applying any linear combination as desired.


## The Search Space

All of the examples above have assumed that *all compatible* models and/or providers are
included in the "search space" when making routing decisions. However,
you might want to limit the search space.
This can be achieved with the `models`, `providers`, `endpoints`, `skip_models`,
`skip_providers`, and `skip_endpoints` keywords.
Again, this is simply specified within the same chain, separated by `|`.

The following finds the fastest (lowest `itl`) endpoint for `llama-3.1-405b-chat`,
among the providers: `groq`, `fireworks-ai` and `together-ai`:

```shell
llama-3.1-405b-chat@itl|providers:groq,fireworks-ai,together-ai
```

The following finds the fastest `llama-3.1-405b-chat` endpoint among *all supported*
providers, *excluding* (skipping): `azure-ai` and `aws-bedrock`:

```shell
llama-3.1-405b-chat@itl|skip_providers:azure-ai,aws-bedrock
```

These keywords are also compatible when routing across models. The following optimizes
a custom metric, whilst only considering the models `gpt-4o`, `o1-preview` and
`claude-3-sonnet`:

```shell
router@q:1|i:0.5|models:gpt-4o,o1-preview,claude-3-sonnet
```

Providers and models can also *both* be limited. The following only considers endpoints
which are within the set of models **and** providers. It does not find the *superset* of
endpoints matching the models and providers, but rather the *subset*. For example,
the endpoints `claude-3-haiku@vertex-ai` and `llama-3-8b-chat@aws-bedrock` are **not**
included in the search space for the query below, but the endpoint
`claude-3-haiku@anthropic` **is** included:

```shell
router@q:1|i:0.5|models:claude-3-haiku,claude-3-sonnet,claude-3-opus|providers:anthropic,aws-bedrock
```

Note that specifying a single model in `models` using the `router` keyword is
functionally equivalent to specifying that model on the left-hand-side:

```shell
router@itl|models:llama-3.1-405b-chat == llama-3.1-405b-chat@itl
```

Given that `skip_{entity}:` and `{entity}:` specify the *only inclusions* or the
*only exclusions*, they **cannot** both be specified in the same query, but they can
for other entities. For example, the following *is* permitted:

```shell
router@q:1|i:0.5|models:claude-3-haiku,claude-3-sonnet|skip_providers:aws-bedrock
```

## Quality Prediction

Up to now, we have not explained how quality is predicted ahead of time for each
endpoint being evaluated, during routing decisions. We have trained a neural scoring
function on many prompts across several open datasets (such as Open Hermes), with the
training targets provided via LLM-as-a-judge.

This is a useful baseline for general tasks, but to really get top performance on your
task, it's necessary to train *your own* neural scoring function on *your own* prompts,
which will result in better performance on your downstream task.

We cover all aspects of training, configuring and deploying your own neural scoring
function for your own fully custom router in the remaining sections!
