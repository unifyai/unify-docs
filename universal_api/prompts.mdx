title: 'Prompts'
---

Terms like prompt, message, query etc. are used very interchangeably, and we've reached
a point where the terms mean everything and nothing.

For example, in OpenAI's
[prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering),
they talk about tool use, structured output, and task decomposition.
In their mental model, the "prompt" is therefore the *entire set of arguments* passed to
the [chat completions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create).
OpenAI are therefore very careful to refer to the `system message` and `user message`,
and avoid calling these messages "prompts".

In contrast, Anthropic does use the term
[system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts)
to refer to the system message.

There is therefore no consensus on whether the "prompt" is only the text content of the
message, the entire json body, or something in between.

## Our Definition

We generally adopt OpenAI's vocabulary, but more specifically we refer to the prompt as
the components of the
[OpenAI Request Body](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)
which **affect the output**. As such, `stream`, `stream_options` etc. are omitted from
our [Prompt](https://github.com/unifyai/unify/blob/af0253995c785898ef3099aa664ac9e9039fe84c/unify/chat/__init__.py#L12).

Our motivation for this is simple. Our platform is primarily built for *evaluations*.
In other words, iterating on the input and assessing how these iterations impact the
output, and more specifically how these changes affect evaluations on the output.

In this light, we're only concerned with storing and tracking the components of the chat
completions request which have an impact on the output, and thus we have adopted this
"prompt" definition.

## Creating Prompts

Creating prompts is easy. If a single string is passed,
then this is interpreted as the user message:

```python
import unify
prompt = unify.Prompt("This is a user message.")
print(prompt)
```
```
Prompt(
    messages=[{'content': 'This is a user message.', 'role': 'user'}],
    frequency_penalty=None,
    logit_bias=None,
    logprobs=None,
    top_logprobs=None,
    max_completion_tokens=None,
    n=None,
    presence_penalty=None,
    response_format=None,
    seed=None,
    stop=None,
    temperature=None,
    top_p=None,
    tools=None,
    tool_choice=None,
    parallel_tool_calls=None,
    extra_headers=None,
    extra_query=None,
    extra_body=None
)
```

By default the representation mode is `"verbose"`, which means the entire pydantic
object is printed. We can prune all `None` values from the representation by setting
`unify.set_repr_mode("concise")`, printing a more concise representation:
```
Prompt(
    "messages": [
        {
            "content": "This is a user message",
            "role": "user"
        }
    ]
)
```

Even when `"concise"` mode is set,
the full representation can be viewed any time like so:

```python
print(prompt.full_repr())
```

For all subsequent printed prompts in the docs,
we will assume `"concise"` mode for brevity.

Returning to the topic of *creating* prompts,
the messages can also be passed explicitly in the `Prompt` constructor:

```python
import unify
prompt = unify.Prompt(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "This is a user message"}]
)
print(prompt)
```
```
Prompt(
    "messages": [
        {
            "content": "This is a user message",
            "role": "user"
        }
    ]
)
```

Other parameters can also be passed:

```python
import unify
another_prompt = unify.Prompt(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "This is another user message"}],
    temperature=0.5
)
print(another_prompt)
```

Only the parameters *explicitly provided* will be printed:

```
Prompt(
    "messages": [
        {
            "content": "This is another user message",
            "role": "user"
        }
    ],
    "temperature": 0.5
)
```

## Passing Prompts

Prompts can be passed to our various clients by simply unpacking the return of their
`.dict()` them as keyword arguments into the constructor (to set default arguments) or
into the `.generate()` method to limit to current query.

```python
import unify
prompt = unify.Prompt(
    temperature=0.5
)
client = unify.Unify(**prompt.dict())
assert client.temperature == 0.5
```

```python
import unify
prompt = unify.Prompt(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "This is a user message"}]
)
client = unify.Unify("gpt-4o@openai")
client.generate(**prompt.dict())
```

As explained in the previous [Arguments](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/arguments)
section, default prompts can be both *extracted* and *set* for clients *directly*.
The default prompt is determined dynamically based on all of the default values
mentioned above during retrieval:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("gpt-4o@openai", temperature=0.5, n=2)
assert client.default_prompt.temperature == 0.5
assert client.default_prompt.n == 2
```

In other direction, setting the default prompt will update the various default
parameters that were explained above:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("gpt-4o@openai", temperature=0.5, n=2)
prompt = unify.Prompt(temperature=0.4)
client.set_default_prompt(prompt)
assert client.temperature == 0.4
assert client.n is None
```
