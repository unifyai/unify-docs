Can be used either as a regular function to create logs or as a decorator to log function inputs, intermediates and outputs.When used as a regular function:
Creates one or more logs associated to a project. unify.Logs are LLM-call-level data
that might depend on other variables.When used as a decorator:
Logs function inputs and intermediate values.

**Arguments**:

- `fn` - When used as a decorator, this is the function to be wrapped.
- `project` - Name of the project the stored logs will be associated to.
- `context` - Context for the logs.
- `params` - Dictionary containing one or more key:value pairs that will be
- `new` - Whether to create a new log if there is a currently active global log.
- `overwrite` - If adding to an existing log, dictates whether or not to overwrite
- `mutable` - Either a boolean to apply uniform mutability for all fields, or a dictionary mapping field names to booleans for per-field control. Defaults to True.
- `api_key` - If specified, unify API key to be used. Defaults to the value in the
- `entries` - Dictionary containing one or more key:value pairs that will be logged



**Returns**:

When used as a regular function: The unique id of newly created log.
When used as a decorator: The wrapped function.
