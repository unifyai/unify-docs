Retrieve a set of log metrics across a project, after applying the filtering.

**Arguments**:

- `metric` - The reduction metric to compute for the specified key. Supported are:
- `key` - The key to compute the reduction statistic for.
- `filter` - The filtering to apply to the various log values, expressed as a string,
- `project` - The id of the project to retrieve the logs for.
- `api_key` - If specified, unify API key to be used. Defaults to the value in the



**Returns**:

The full set of reduced log metrics for the project, after optionally applying
the optional filtering.
