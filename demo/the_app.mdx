title: 'The App'
---

According to [QA Education](https://qaeducation.co.uk/feature/uk-teachers-spend-whole-day-marking-each-week/),
teachers spend a whole day on marking each week, and the majority say they do not spend enough time teaching as a result.
Let's try and fix this using AI!

We'll use LLMs to build an app that marks students answers, given a known markscheme.
We have to start somewhere, so let's start with some practice exam papers for high school level maths.

To kick things off, we've parsed [three practice exam papers](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/tree/main/ai_tutor/data/parsed/GCSE_(9%E2%80%931)_Mathematics)
from [OCR's Sample Assessment Material for GCSE Maths](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/169000-foundation-tier-sample-assessment-materials.pdf),
and used o1 to generate synthetic student answers which o1 believes are appropriate for each possible number of marks to be awarded.

The details for these preliminary steps are not important,
but you're welcome to dig deeper if interested.

- the [script](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/blob/main/ai_tutor/generate_data.py) and [data](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/blob/main/ai_tutor/data/labelled_data.json) for the synthetic student answers

For the demo, we'll go through the following steps:

1. Create a Dataset 🗂️
2. Analyze Production Traffic 🚦
3. Iterate and Improve our Agent 🔁


Let's dive in! 🤿
