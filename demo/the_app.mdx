# Motivation

According to [QA Education](https://qaeducation.co.uk/feature/uk-teachers-spend-whole-day-marking-each-week/),
teachers spend a whole day on marking each week, and the majority say they do not spend enough time teaching as a result.
Let's try and fix this using AI!

We'll use LLMs to build an app that asks students questions *and* marks their answers, given a known markscheme.
We have to start somewhere, so let's start with some practice exam papers for high school level maths.

# Data

To kick things off, we've parsed [three practice exam papers](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/tree/main/marking_assistant/data/parsed/GCSE_(9%E2%80%931)_Mathematics)
from [OCR's Sample Assessment Material for GCSE Maths](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/169000-foundation-tier-sample-assessment-materials.pdf),
and used OpenAI's o1 model to generate synthetic student answers which o1 believes are appropriate for each possible number of marks to be awarded.

The details for these preliminary steps are not important,
but you're welcome to dig deeper if interested.
Feel free to check out:

- the [script](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/blob/main/marking_assistant/fetch_and_parse_pdf.py) and [data](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/tree/main/marking_assistant/data/parsed/GCSE_(9%E2%80%931)_Mathematics) for the parsed papers and markschemes

- the [script](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/blob/main/marking_assistant/generate_data.py) and [data](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/blob/main/marking_assistant/data/labelled_data.json) for the synthetic student answers and target marks to award

- the [script](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/blob/main/marking_assistant/generate_test_dataset.py) and [data](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/blob/main/marking_assistant/data/test_set.json) for building the resultant test set, for our agent evaluations

# Steps

For the demo, we'll make use of this synthetic data, and walk through the following three steps:

1. Build a Usage Dashboard 📊
2. Upload Eval Datasets 🗂️
3. Iterate and Improve our Agent 🔁

Let's dive in! 🤿
