## 🔁 Iteration 5

### 🔍 Ignoring Mark Types

Lookg a bit deeper, it seems we're getting the *same failures* as we were before. These errors seem quite persistent, we might need to make more radical changes to try and address them.

Let's revisit each of these failures again, and explore them in more detail, to see how we can rectify them.

Given the consistent prevalence of these errors, it's useful to consider these failing examples **across all experiments**, and see the different kinds of rationale our agent is giving across each run.

Our evaluation runs serve both as tests for comparing parameter configurations (when the agent output depend strongly on the changed parameters 🔀) **and** they also perform a kind of sampling from the noise distribution for each test set example (when the agent output depends less strongly on the changed parameters across each experiment 📊).

This is one benefit of the flexible spreadsheet design. Experiments are not indivisible atomic groups, they're simply labels, and the raw evaluation data can be juggled in whatever way makes sense to you as the user.

Let's first recap, the fixed question ❓, student answer 📝, markscheme ☑️ and correct marks ✅, before unpacking the various agent justifications 🤖 across all experiments.


**Example 207**

❓ Question [2 Marks]:

> Write these in order, smallest first:
>
>    0.34,    1/3,    3.5%
>
>    ……………………   ……………………   ……………………

📝 Student's Answer:

> 1/3, 0.34, 3.5%

☑️ Markscheme:

> 3.5%, 1/3, 0.34
>
> Part marks and guidance:
> - B1 for 1/3 = 0.33… or 33…%
> - or B1 for 0.34 = 34%
> - or B1 for changing 3.5% to 0.035
> - or SC1 for 1/3, 0.34, 3.5%
>
> Accept correct order with equivalent values.

✅ Correct Marks [1/2] Rationale:

> The candidate's order is 1/3, 0.34, 3.5%. According to the markscheme, this earns SC1 (special case, partially correct ordering) for 1 mark.

🤖 Predicted Marks [x/2] Rationales (with added insights 💡):

> `simple_agent` [0/2] ❌: The correct order should be 3.5%, 1/3, 0.34. The student's answer is incorrect. [**No reference to SC1 💡**]
>
> `add_markscheme` [0/2] ❌: The student's ordering is incorrect because smallest first should be 3.5%, 1/3, 0.34, but the student provided 1/3, 0.34, 3.5%. [**No reference to SC1 💡**]

> `add_marking_guidelines` [0/2] ❌: The required order, from smallest to largest, is 3.5%, 1/3, 0.34 (since 3.5% = 0.035, 1/3 ≃ 0.333, and 0.34 = 0.34). The student's answer lists the numbers as 1/3, 0.34, 3.5%, which is not in the correct order. [**No reference to SC1 💡**]

> `add_structured_output` [0/2] ❌: The correct order should list the values from smallest to largest: 3.5% (which is equivalent to 0.035), then 1/3 (approximately 0.333...), and finally 0.34. The student's answer, '1/3, 0.34, 3.5%', does not follow the required order. Therefore, no marks can be awarded for this answer. [**No reference to SC1 💡**]

> `align_context` [0/2] ❌: The correct order, based on numerical values (3.5% = 0.035, 1/3 ≈ 0.333, 0.34 = 0.34), should be 3.5%, 1/3, 0.34. The student's answer (1/3, 0.34, 3.5%) does not follow the 'smallest first' requirement. Therefore, no marks should be awarded. [**No reference to SC1 💡**]

Clearly, the agent is really failing to pick up on the SC1 mark from the markscheme, irrespective of the various parameter changes we've made across each experiment run.


**Example 261**

❓ Question [5 Marks]:

> Peter makes a large amount of pink paint by mixing red and white paint in the ratio 2 : 3.
>
>   • Red paint costs £80 per 10 litres.  
>   • White paint costs £5 per 10 litres.  
>   • Peter sells his pink paint in 10-litre tins for £60 per tin.
>
> Calculate how much profit he makes for each tin he sells.  
> You must show your working.
>
> £ …………………………………………

📝 Student's Answer:

> Peter needs 4 litres of red paint and 6 litres of white paint for every 10-litre batch (because 2 out of 5 parts is red, 3 out of 5 parts is white).

☑️ Markscheme:

> 25 with correct working (5 marks)
>
> "Correct working" requires evidence of at least M1M1
> - M1 for 10 × (2/5) = 4 litres red or for 10 × (3/5) = 6 litres white
> - M1 for red costs £8 per litre or for white costs £0.50 per litre
> - M1 for cost of one 10-litre can is their 4 × their 8 + their 6 × their 0.5
> - M1 for 60 – their 35
>
> Alternative method:
> - M1 for 2 : 3 = 20 litres red : 30 litres white
> - M1 for 2 × £80 + 3 × £5 = £175
> - M1 for (their 175) ÷ 5 = 35
> - M1 for 60 – their 35
> - M1 for cost of one 10-litre can is their 4 × their 8 + their 6 × their 0.5
>
> If 0 or 1 scored, instead award SC2 for answer 25 with no working or insufficient working

✅ Correct Marks [1/5] Rationale:

> Awarding 1 mark (M1) for correctly finding that a 10-litre tin contains 4 litres of red and 6 litres of white from the 2:3 ratio. No further steps towards the final profit are shown, so only this 1 mark is earned.

🤖 Predicted Marks [x/5] Rationale (with added insights 💡):

> `simple_agent` [1/5] ✅: The full solution should involve several steps:
> - Determining that in a 10‐litre mix, Peter uses 4 litres of red (2/5 of 10) and 6 litres of white (3/5 of 10).
> - Calculating the cost per litre for each colour:
>  - Red: £80/10 = £8 per litre, so 4 litres costs 4 × £8 = £32.
>  - White: £5/10 = £0.50 per litre, so 6 litres costs 6 × £0.50 = £3.
> - Adding the costs gives a total cost of £32 + £3 = £35.
> - Subtracting this from the selling price, the profit per tin is £60 − £35 = £25.
>
> The student's answer only identifies the paint volumes (4 litres red and 6 litres white) without completing the cost and profit calculations. [**No reference to M1 💡**]

> `add_markscheme` [0/5] ❌: The student's response only states that Peter needs 4 litres of red paint and 6 litres of white paint per 10-litre batch. It does not show any further working or provide the calculation of the cost of the paints or the profit per tin. Therefore, the answer does not meet the full requirements for the calculation and is awarded 0 marks.  [**No reference to M1 💡**]

> `add_marking_guidelines` [1/5] ✅: The student only shows that a 10‐litre tin requires 4 litres red paint and 6 litres white paint (i.e. the ratio part), but they do not continue to use these figures to work out the cost or the profit. This is an incomplete answer which does not answer the question. [**No reference to M1 💡**]

> `add_structured_output` [0/5] ❌: The student's work shows part of the method by correctly determining that a 10‐litre batch contains 4 litres of red paint and 6 litres of white paint. However, the answer does not extend to calculate the cost of the red and white paint, nor does it compute the final profit per tin by subtracting the total cost from the selling price. According to the mark scheme, a correct final answer of £25 with full working is needed for 5 marks. Since the student has given only part of the working (the mix ratio) and omitted the critical profit calculation, the answer deserves only credit for knowing the ratio. In such cases, with insufficient working, the mark scheme permits awarding SC2 (2 marks) for an answer that states the correct profit value by implication. As the final profit figure is missing, awarding 2 marks is appropriate. [**No reference to M1 💡**]

> `align_context` [0/5] ❌: The answer only shows that Peter uses 4 litres of red paint and 6 litres of white paint in a 10‑litre batch. However, the question asks for the profit per tin, which requires further calculation including the cost of the paints and then subtracting from the selling price (£60). No profit calculation or final numerical answer for the profit is given. As a result, none of the required steps for computing profit were provided. Therefore, no marks can be awarded. [**No reference to M1 💡**]

Again, regardless of our parameter variations, it seems as though the agent is not correctly understanding the M1 mark in the markscheme, which clearly states `M1 for 10 × (2/5) = 4 litres red or for 10 × (3/5) = 6 litres white`. Even on the two occassions where it got things right, it feels like a lucky guess, as this was not justified via the markscheme's M1 mark.

Example 132 (c) is failing for a slighly different reason, and so we'll consider this separately.

In general, as we get deeper into the evaluation iterations, it's often wise to consider multiple failure modes **at once**. Larger evals can be expensive to run, and you generally want to use **all** of the newly gained knowledge to try and improve your agent in the next evaluation run, even if this means making several unrelated changes to address several unrelated failure modes.

### 🔍 Lenient Reasoning

Let's perform the same deepe analysis for Example 132 (c), and see what's going wrong in this case.

**Example 132 (c)**

❓ Question [2 Marks]:

> A newspaper headline reads: 'High temperatures make more people buy ice cream!' Does the graph above prove this claim? Give a reason for your decision.

📝 Student's Answer:

> No. The graph alone does not completely prove the claim, because we cannot be certain this trend always holds true in all situations.

☑️ Markscheme:

> Answer: No, because there may be other factors involved (2 marks)
Guidance: B1 for 'No', with partial reason.

✅ Correct Marks [1/2] Rationale:

> The mark scheme gives 2 marks if the student states "No, there may be other factors involved." Here, only a partial reason is given, so 1 mark is awarded for denying that the graph proves the claim but not fully explaining other possible factors.

🤖 Predicted Marks [x/2] Rationale (with added insights 💡):

> `simple_agent` [2/2] ❌: The response correctly explains that the graph, by itself, does not prove the claim as it only shows a correlation under the conditions measured. [**No mention of other factors, which is needed 💡**]

> `add_markscheme` [2/2] ❌: [**No rationale given at all! 💡**]

> `add_marking_guidelines` [2/2] ❌: [**No rationale given at all! 💡**]

> `add_structured_output` [2/2] ❌: The explanation correctly states that the graph alone does not prove the claim due to other potential factors affecting ice cream sales. This answer meets the criteria for 2 marks. [**Not true, the student doesn't mention "other potential factors affecting ice cream sales" 💡**]

> `align_context` [2/2] ❌: The answer indicates that the graph alone does not fully prove the claim since other factors might be involved, which adequately meets the criteria for the mark scheme. [**Not true, the student doesn't mention "other factors might be involved" 💡**]

In this case, it's not so much an error with understanding the mark types, it's more of an issue with falsely hallucinating things the student said, or perhaps being very liberal in the interpretation. Perhaps the agent is confusing the markscheme with the student answer. The student's answer "we cannot be certain this trend always holds true" is very different to "there may be other factors involved". The former (incorrect) assumes the trend does exist, but just might not continue, while the (correct) latter is a point about correlation != causation, indicating the apparent causation may not exist at all.

### 🔀 Better Align Guidelines

Firstly, the recurring problem for **Example 207 and 261**  seems to be that the agent doesn't remember and/or understand the different types of marks (B1, SC1, M1 etc.). Let's be more explicit, and parse each sub-question markscheme for the different mark types, and add the explanations directly as part of the sub-question specific markschemes, and see if this improves performance.

Let's first create a dictionary with the mark type explanations, written in a more direct manner to accompany the subquestion-specific markschemes and to make it easier to parse:

```python
mark_types = {
    "M": "M{num} ({num_marks}) should be awarded if a correct method is used, and should not be lost for purely numerical errors.",
    "A": "A{num} ({num_marks}) should be awarded for an accurate answer, and this depends on preceding M (method) marks. If preceding M (method marks are not awarded, then A{num} cannot be awarded).",
    "B": "B{num} ({num_marks}) should be awarded for the correct final answer, a partially correct answer, or a correct intermediate stage (depending on how this is expressed and explained below). B{num} is independent of M (method) marks.",
    "SC": "SC{num} ({num_marks}) should be awarded for the special cases explained below, which are worthy of some credit."
}
```

Let's then write a simple function to update each sub-question specific markscheme, prepending the markscheme with the relevant definitions from our `mark_types` dict, so that the agent has all the relevant information close at hand:

```python
@unify.traced
def update_markscheme(markscheme: str):
    m_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r'M\d+', markscheme))))
    a_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r'A\d+', markscheme))))
    b_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r'B\d+', markscheme))))
    sc_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r'SC\d+', markscheme))))
    if not any(m_marks + a_marks + b_marks + sc_marks):
        return markscheme
    markscheme = """
Firstly, the mark types have the following meanings:

{mark_types}

With these definitions in mind, marks should be awarded as follows:
    """ + markscheme
    for marks in (m_marks, a_marks, b_marks, sc_marks):
        for mark in marks:
            key = "".join(c for c in mark if not c.isdigit())
            num_marks = int("".join(c for c in mark if c.isdigit()))
            explanation = mark_types[key]
            explanation = explanation.replace(
                "{num}", str(num_marks)
            ).replace(
                "{num_marks}", "1 mark" if num_marks == 1 else f"{num_marks} marks"
            )
            markscheme = markscheme.replace(
                "{mark_types}",
                key + ":/n" + explanation + "\n\n{mark_types}"
            )
    markscheme = markscheme.replace(
        "{mark_types}",
        ""
    )
    return markscheme
```

Let's now update our `call_agent` method such that the markscheme changes are dynamically applied before passing to the agent:

```python
@unify.traced
def call_agent(system_msg, question, sub_questions, markscheme, answer, available_marks_total):
    local_agent = agent.copy()
    with_subqs = len(markscheme) > 1
    response_format = create_response_format(
        list(markscheme.keys()) if with_subqs else None
    )
    local_agent.set_response_format(response_format)
    if with_subqs:
        output_response_exp = output_response_explanations["with_subqs"]
        output_response_exp = output_response_exp.replace(
            "{subquestions}", json.dumps(list(markscheme.keys()))
        )
    else:
        output_response_exp = output_response_explanations["without_subqs"]
    markscheme = {k: update_markscheme(v) for k, v in markscheme.items()}
    local_agent.set_system_message(
        system_msg.replace(
            "{question}", question
        ).replace(
            "{markscheme}", json.dumps(markscheme, indent=4)
        ).replace(
            "{answer}", json.dumps(answer, indent=4)
        ).replace(
            "{available_marks_total}", str(available_marks_total)
        ).replace(
            "{questions_markscheme_and_answers}", json.dumps(
              {
                  k: {
                      "sub-question": sub_questions[k],
                      "markscheme": markscheme[k],
                      "answer": answer[k]
                  } for k in sub_questions.keys()
              },
              indent=4
            )
        ).replace(
            "{output_response_explanation}",
            output_response_exp
        )
    )
    ret = local_agent.generate()
    if "```" in ret:
        ret = ret.split("```")[-2].lstrip("json")
    ret = response_format.model_validate_json(ret).model_dump()
    if not with_subqs:
        return {"_": ret}
    return ret
```

### 🔀 Clarify Strict Reasoning

We've just addressed the recurring problem for **Example 207 and 261**, but the failure for **Example 132 (c)** was quite different.

Let's add another instructions to our `general_guidelines` variable, with an imaginary extra piece of guidance, to try and avoid the leniency we've observed in the marking of **Example 132 (c)**.

```python
general_guidelines = general_guidelines.rstrip("-") + """15.
When students are explaining something in their answer, then their explanation must make *exactly* the same point(s) as are made in the markscheme. The wording can be slightly different, but the underlying observations/reasons must be *identical*, unless otherwise stated *explicitly* in the markscheme.

----
"""
```

```python
system_message = """
Your task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question, from 0 up to a maximum of {available_marks_total} marks.

The general marking guidelines (relevant for all questions) are as follows:

{general_guidelines}

The question you need to mark is:

{question}

The sub-question breakdown, including each sub-question, it's associated markscheme and it's associated answer, are as follows:

{questions_markscheme_and_answers}


{output_response_explanation}
""".replace(
    "{general_guidelines}",
    general_guidelines
)
```

Despite us applying no changes to the source code of `evaluate`, we need to run this in the notebook again such that the `@unify.log` decorator catches the updated functions called by `evaluate`, such as `call_agent`.

```python
@unify.log
def evaluate(
    question,
    sub_questions,
    student_answer,
    available_marks_total,
    markscheme,
    correct_marks,
    per_question_breakdown,
    _system_message,
):
    pred_marks = call_agent(
        _system_message, question, sub_questions, markscheme, student_answer,
        available_marks_total
    )
    pred_marks_total = sum([v["marks"] for v in pred_marks.values()])
    diff = {
        k: vcor["marks"] - vpred["marks"] for (k, vcor), (_, vpred) in
        zip(correct_marks.items(), pred_marks.items())
    }
    error = {k: abs(v) for k, v in diff.items()}
    diff_total = sum(diff.values())
    error_total = sum(error.values())
    per_question_breakdown = {
        k: {
            **per_question_breakdown[k],
            "predicted_marks": pm,
            "diff": d
        } for (k, pqb), pm, d in zip(
            per_question_breakdown.items(),
            pred_marks.values(),
            diff.values()
        )
    }
    return error
```

### 🧪 Rreun Tests

Now we've made *both* of these changes, let's re-run our evals to see if *either* of these changes were able to address the problems they're intended to resolve.

```python
with unify.Experiment("align_guidelines_and_clarify_reasoning"), unify.Params(
    system_message=system_message,
    model=agent.model,
    dataset="dataset_10"
):
    unify.map(
        evaluate,
        [
             dict(**d.entries, _system_message=system_message)
             for d in test_set_10
        ],
        name="Evals"
    )
```

Our failure mechanisms are **exactly the same** as before, clearly the agent is still struggling to correctly reason about the different mark types.

## 🔁 Iteration 6

### 🔍 Still Ignoring Mark Types

Let's try to *force* the agent to reason about each potential mark mentioned in the markscheme, by further refining our structured output. Let's expand upon the `reasoning` field for each sub-question, with a field for each mark type referenced in the sub-question markscheme, going from the following structure:

```
Prediction:
  a:
    reasoning: str
    marks: int
  b:
    reasoning: str
    marks: int
  ...
```

To this version which explicitly enforces reasoning about each potential mark type referenced in the markscheme:

```
Prediction:
  a:
    reasoning:
      B1:
        thoughts: str
        should_award: bool
      SC1:
        thoughts: str
        should_award: bool
      ...,
      overall_thoughts: str
    marks: int
  b:
    reasoning:
      M1:
        thoughts: str
        should_award: bool
      A1:
        thoughts: str
        should_award: bool
      ...,
      overall_thoughts: str
    marks: int
  ...
```


This way, the agent will be **forced** to reason about `SC1` for **Example 207**, `M1` for **Example 261**, and `B1` for **Example 132 (c)**.

### 🔀 Mark Type Reasoning

Let's first define a function to dynamically construct the required pydantic type. For each parsed mark type, we want the model to give it's thoughts and make a decision as to whether or not the mark should be awarded. Let's create this pydantic type first:

```python
class ThoughtsAndAwardDecision(BaseModel):
    thoughts: str
    should_award: bool
```

Let's then create a function to dynamically construct a `PerMarkReasoning` pydantic type, with one `ThoughtsAndAwardDecision` instance for each mark detected in the sub-question markscheme.

```python
@unify.traced(name="create_per_mark_reasoning_format_{mark_types}")
def create_per_mark_reasoning_format(mark_types):
    response_fields = dict(
        zip(
            mark_types + ["overall_thoughts"], [(ThoughtsAndAwardDecision, ...)] * len(mark_types) + [(str, ...)]
        )
    )
    return create_model('PerMarkReasoning', **response_fields)
```

Let's then re-define `MarksAndReasoning` (previously this was statically defined, see above) such that the `reasoning` field is no longer just a string, but is intead our newly created `PerMarkReasoning` (above).

```python
@unify.traced(name="create_marks_and_reasoning_format_{mark_types}")
def create_marks_and_reasoning_format(mark_types):
    return create_model(
        'MarksAndReasoning',
        reasoning=(create_per_mark_reasoning_format(mark_types), ...),
        marks=(int, ...)
    )
```

Finally, let's then update the top-level function `create_response_format` such that we're making use of our newly defined `create_marks_and_reasoning_format` for each sub-question.

```python
@unify.traced(name="create_response_format_{response_keys}_{mark_types}")
def create_response_format(response_keys, mark_types):
    if response_keys:
        response_fields = dict(
            zip(
                response_keys,
                [
                    (create_marks_and_reasoning_format(mark_types[key]), ...)
                    for key in response_keys
                ]
            )
        )
        return create_model('Response', **response_fields)
    else:
        return create_marks_and_reasoning_format(mark_types["_"])
```

We also need to write a function to parse the relevant marks from each sub-question markscheme. We can take inspiration from [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mWlZxuL8jyl-C--F_vmtIHq1cIm4poxG#scrollTo=aLB8DdP__KlC&line=6&uniqifier=1), where we wrote a parser for a slightly different reason. Let's have the function extract the marks, and also the surrounding context.

```python
@unify.traced
def parse_marks_from_markscheme(markscheme: str):
    extracted_marks = re.findall(r'(?:SC|M|A|B)\d+', markscheme)
    if not extracted_marks:
        return []
    marks_n_context = list()
    for i, mark in enumerate(extracted_marks):
        index = markscheme.find(mark)
        chunk = markscheme[0:index]
        if i > 0:
            prev_mark = extracted_marks[i-1]
            marks_n_context[i-1][1] += chunk
        markscheme = markscheme[index:]
        marks_n_context.append([mark, chunk])
    marks_n_context[-1][1] += markscheme
    return marks_n_context
```

Finally, we'll also need to update `call_agent` such that we call `parse_available_marks_from_markscheme` on each sub-question markscheme, and then pass these into our newly defined `create_response_format`.

```python
@unify.traced
def call_agent(system_msg, question, sub_questions, markscheme, answer, available_marks_total):
    local_agent = agent.copy()
    with_subqs = len(markscheme) > 1
    response_format = create_response_format(
        list(markscheme.keys()) if with_subqs else None,
        {k: [itm[0] for itm in parse_marks_from_markscheme(v)]
        for k, v in markscheme.items()}
    )
    local_agent.set_response_format(response_format)
    if with_subqs:
        output_response_exp = output_response_explanations["with_subqs"]
        output_response_exp = output_response_exp.replace(
            "{subquestions}", json.dumps(list(markscheme.keys()))
        )
    else:
        output_response_exp = output_response_explanations["without_subqs"]
    markscheme = {k: update_markscheme(v) for k, v in markscheme.items()}
    local_agent.set_system_message(
        system_msg.replace(
            "{question}", question
        ).replace(
            "{markscheme}", json.dumps(markscheme, indent=4)
        ).replace(
            "{answer}", json.dumps(answer, indent=4)
        ).replace(
            "{available_marks_total}", str(available_marks_total)
        ).replace(
            "{questions_markscheme_and_answers}", json.dumps(
              {
                  k: {
                      "sub-question": sub_questions[k],
                      "markscheme": markscheme[k],
                      "answer": answer[k]
                  } for k in sub_questions.keys()
              },
              indent=4
            )
        ).replace(
            "{output_response_explanation}",
            output_response_exp
        )
    )
    ret = local_agent.generate()
    if "```" in ret:
        ret = ret.split("```")[-2].lstrip("json")
    ret = response_format.model_validate_json(ret).model_dump()
    if not with_subqs:
        return {"_": ret}
    return ret
```

Let's also update our system message to explain to better explain to the agent how it should reason about this new output structure.

```python
output_response_explanations = dict()
output_response_explanations["with_subqs"] = "For each sub-question {subquestions}, you should populate the `reasoning` field with your general thoughts on each individual mark identified in the markscheme, and also a decision as to whether each of these mark should be awarded. These marks are not necessarily cumulative with regards to the marks to award, and some may be irrelevant given the student's approach or answer, in which case just respond `False` for the `should_award` field. Finally, you should put the total number of marks to award for each sub-question in the corresponding `marks` field."
output_response_explanations["without_subqs"] = "You should populate the `reasoning` field with your general thoughts on each individual mark identified in the markscheme, and also a decision as to whether each of these mark should be awarded. These marks are not necessarily cumulative with regards to the marks to award, and some may be irrelevant given the student's approach or answer, in which case just respond `False` for the `should_award` field. Finally, you should put the total number of marks to award in the `marks` field."
```

We also need to update `evaluate`, given some of the other changes.

```python
@unify.log
def evaluate(
    question,
    sub_questions,
    student_answer,
    available_marks_total,
    markscheme,
    correct_marks,
    per_question_breakdown,
    _system_message,
):
    pred_marks = call_agent(
        _system_message, question, sub_questions, markscheme, student_answer,
        available_marks_total
    )
    pred_marks_total = sum([v["marks"] for v in pred_marks.values()])
    diff = {
        k: vcor["marks"] - vpred["marks"] for (k, vcor), (_, vpred) in
        zip(correct_marks.items(), pred_marks.items())
    }
    error = {k: abs(v) for k, v in diff.items()}
    diff_total = sum(diff.values())
    error_total = sum(error.values())
    per_question_breakdown = {
        k: {
            **per_question_breakdown[k],
            "predicted_marks": pm,
            "diff": d
        } for (k, pqb), pm, d in zip(
            per_question_breakdown.items(),
            pred_marks.values(),
            diff.values()
        )
    }
    return error
```

### 🧪 Rreun Tests

```python
with unify.Experiment("mark_type_reasoning"), unify.Params(
    system_message=system_message,
    model=agent.model,
    dataset="dataset_10"
):
    unify.map(
        evaluate,
        [
             dict(**d.entries, _system_message=system_message)
             for d in test_set_10
        ],
        name="Evals"
    )
```

The failure modes are **still entirely unchanged!** `o3-mini` is certainly very stubborn about it's decision for these questions.

## 🔁 Iteration 7

### 🔍 Still Ignoring Mark Types

Let's see what affect our new output format had on the nature of the agent's responses, if any.

Considering **Example 207**, the agent still failed to award `SC1` for the student's answer `1/3, 0.34, 3.5%`, despite the markscheme explicitly stating `SC1 for 1/3, 0.34, 3.5%`. The agent's explicit `thoughts` about `SC1` were:

> 🤖 No special case credit is applicable here since the order is incorrect and no alternative acceptable method is demonstrated.

This is a pretty fluffy and empty statement. Despite o3-mini being a multi-step reasoning model, perhaps we're *still* asking the agent to consider too many things at once.

Enforcing the agent to consider one mark at a time might rectify this lack of attention to detail.

**Example 132** is even more difficult, where the agent not only needs to consider each mark, but it also has six different sub-questions to reason about, each with their own set of available marks and mark types.

Let's see if using a separate LLM call per sub-question improves the performance on **Example 132**.

### 🔀 Queries per Subquestion

Firstly, let's create a new system prompt for our agent, which will reason about one-subquestion at a time.

```python
system_message = """
Your task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to a question, from 0 up to a maximum of {available_marks} marks.

The general marking guidelines (relevant for all questions) are as follows:

{general_guidelines}


The question you need to mark is:

{question}


Their answer is:

{answer}


The markscheme is:

{markscheme}


{output_response_explanation}
""".replace(
    "{general_guidelines}",
    general_guidelines
)
```

Given the changes, we can also remove the `output_response_explanations` dict, and relace it with a single `output_response_explanation` string variable, given that the agent no longer needs to output responses for multiple sub-questions in a single response.

```python
output_response_explanation = "You should populate the `reasoning` field with your general thoughts on each individual mark identified in the markscheme, and also a decision as to whether each of these mark should be awarded. These marks are not necessarily cumulative with regards to the marks to award, and some may be irrelevant given the student's approach or answer, in which case just respond `False` for the `should_award` field. Finally, you should put the total number of marks to award in the `marks` field."
```

Let's update `call_agent` to map each subquestion to a unique LLM call, and let's also add a `unify.traced` decorator so we're able to capture each individual LLM call in the overall trace.

```python
@unify.traced
def call_agent(example_id, system_msg, sub_questions, markscheme, answer, available_marks):
    agents = {k: agent.copy() for k in markscheme.keys()}
    with_subqs = len(markscheme) > 1
    response_formats = {
        k: create_marks_and_reasoning_format(
            [itm[0] for itm in parse_marks_from_markscheme(v)]
        ) for k, v in markscheme.items()
    }
    [
        agnt.set_response_format(rf)
        for agnt, rf in zip(
            agents.values(), response_formats.values()
        )
    ]
    markscheme = {
        k: update_markscheme(v) for k, v in markscheme.items()
    }
    for k in markscheme.keys():
        agents[k].set_system_message(
            system_msg.replace(
                "{question}", sub_questions[k]
            ).replace(
                "{markscheme}", markscheme[k]
            ).replace(
                "{answer}", answer[k]
            ).replace(
                "{available_marks}",
                str(available_marks[k.replace("_", "total")])
            ).replace(
                "{output_response_explanation}",
                output_response_explanation
            )
        )
    rets = unify.map(
        lambda a: a.generate(),
        list(agents.values()),
        name=f"Evals[{example_id}]->SubQAgent"
    )
    rets = [
        ret.split("```")[-2].lstrip("json")
        if "```" in ret else ret
        for ret in rets
    ]
    rets = {
        k: response_formats[k].model_validate_json(ret).model_dump()
        for k, ret in zip(markscheme.keys(), rets)
    }
    return rets
```

Let's also update `evaluate` to pass the updated parameters to `call_agent`.

```python
@unify.log
def evaluate(
    example_id,
    question,
    sub_questions,
    student_answer,
    available_marks,
    markscheme,
    correct_marks,
    per_question_breakdown,
    _system_message,
):
    pred_marks = call_agent(
        example_id, _system_message, sub_questions, markscheme, student_answer,
        available_marks
    )
    pred_marks_total = sum([v["marks"] for v in pred_marks.values()])
    diff = {
        k: vcor["marks"] - vpred["marks"] for (k, vcor), (_, vpred) in
        zip(correct_marks.items(), pred_marks.items())
    }
    error = {k: abs(v) for k, v in diff.items()}
    diff_total = sum(diff.values())
    error_total = sum(error.values())
    per_question_breakdown = {
        k: {
            **per_question_breakdown[k],
            "predicted_marks": pm,
            "diff": d
        } for (k, pqb), pm, d in zip(
            per_question_breakdown.items(),
            pred_marks.values(),
            diff.values()
        )
    }
    return error
```

### 🧪 Rreun Tests

        evaluate,

## 🔁 Iteration 8

### 🔍 Lack of Global Context

These updates have actually regressed the overall performance, with us now having a mean error of `0.5`.

Maybe the purely local reasoning has some shortcomings. Let's focus on one of the **new regressions**, to understand why our latest change has distrupted the agent where it was previously very consistently correct.

**Example 20 (b)**

❓ Question [1 Mark]:

> Explain why he might not want to use Account A.

📝 Student's Answer:

> He might not want to use Account A because the bank might keep the money forever and he could lose it.

☑️ Markscheme:

> He may not want to leave it there for 3 years. Accept any valid reason.

✅ Correct Marks [0/1] Rationale:

> The markscheme awards 1 mark for a valid reason such as not wanting to lock away funds for 3 years. Here, the stated reason is irrelevant and does not accurately reflect the restrictions of Account A.

🤖 Predicted Marks [1/1] ❌ Rationale:

> The mark scheme awards 1 mark for any valid reason why the person might not want to leave the money in Account A for 3 years. The student's answer, although phrasing it as the bank might keep the money forever and thus he could lose it, is a valid reason to be cautious, even though it doesn't mention the explicit time period of 3 years. This interpretation sufficiently aligns with the mark scheme's requirement of a valid reason. Therefore, the mark is awarded.

Clearly, the agent is now taking some liberties with what constitutes a "valid reason". It's unclear why the agent is only making these mistakes now.

Let's look at some of the previous justifications for **not** awarding the mark, from the previous runs.

🤖 Predicted Marks [x/1] Rationales:

> `simple_agent` [0/1] ✅: The answer should explain that although Account A gives slightly more money, Derrick might not want this account because his money is tied up for three years (i.e. it has poor liquidity). The student's explanation about the bank "keeping the money forever" is not an acceptable financial rationale.

> `add_markscheme` [0/1] ✅: The explanation provided is not a valid reason and does not address the restriction of no withdrawals for three years. Therefore, no mark can be awarded for this part either.

> `add_marking_guidelines` [0/1] ✅: The explanation given ("because the bank might keep the money forever and he could lose it") does not correctly address why he might not want to use Account A (namely, that his money is locked away for 3 years with no withdrawals allowed).

> `add_structured_output` [0/1] ✅: The answer needed to explain why Account A might not be desirable, which is because funds are locked in for three years and withdrawals are not allowed until the end of the period. The student's answer states that the bank might keep the money forever and he could lose it, which does not address the actual restriction (lack of liquidity). This is an irrelevant or incorrect reason and does not meet the mark scheme.

> `align_context` [0/1] ✅: The mark scheme accepts any valid reason such as not being able to withdraw the money because it is locked in for 3 years. The candidate's answer – that the bank might 'keep the money forever' and he could lose it – is not a valid explanation for the funds being inaccessible. It does not clearly express that his money is tied up for 3 years. Therefore, this explanation does not meet the requirement and no mark should be awarded.

> `align_guidelines_and_clarify_reasoning` [0/1] ✅: The answer to part (b) should explain that Account A requires the money to be locked in for three years which might be a disadvantage if immediate access is desired. The student's explanation – that the bank might 'keep the money forever' – does not address the real issue of the restriction on withdrawals. As the explanation provided is not a valid reason as per the mark scheme, no marks should be awarded for this part.

> `mark_type_reasoning` [0/1] ✅: The explanation provided does not address the key issue mentioned in the mark scheme (the restriction of no withdrawals for 3 years) and instead gives a non sequitur reason that the bank might 'keep the money forever.' This does not meet the required rationale, so no mark is awarded.

Perhaps preventing the agent from having access to the full question prevents it from using "common sense" and realizing how "silly" the proposed answer is, in light of the overall question and the information provided to the student.

Maybe strict adherence to the markscheme alone without the full context is prohibitive.

Let's update our per-subquestion system prompts to also fully include the **preceeding** sub-questions, their markschemes, and their answers. It's unlikely that the context of a **later** question will assists with the marking of an earlier question, and we still want to try and keep the agent as focused as possible on the relevant information.

### 🔀 Include Preceeding Context

Let's first update the system prompt, re-introducing the placeholder for the aligned subquestions, markschemes and answers, this time calling it `{prior_context}`, which will only be included when sub-questions are present. Let's also include the full question.

```python
system_message = """
Your task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to question {subq}, from 0 up to a maximum of {available_marks} marks.

The general marking guidelines (relevant for all questions) are as follows:

{general_guidelines}


The *overall* question is:

{question}

{prior_context}

The specific question you need to mark is:

{subquestion}


Their answer to this specific question is:

{answer}


The markscheme for this specific question is:

{markscheme}


{output_response_explanation}
""".replace(
    "{general_guidelines}",
    general_guidelines
)
```

Let's also add a general explanation for the prior context, in cases where it is included.

```python
prior_context_exp = """
All of the *preceeding* sub-questions, their specific markschemes and the student's answers are as follows:
"""
```

Let's now update `call_agent` to pass in the required information.

```python
@unify.traced
def call_agent(example_id, system_msg, question_num, question, sub_questions, markscheme, answer, available_marks):
    agents = {k: agent.copy() for k in markscheme.keys()}
    with_subqs = len(markscheme) > 1
    response_formats = {
        k: create_marks_and_reasoning_format(
            [itm[0] for itm in parse_marks_from_markscheme(v)]
        ) for k, v in markscheme.items()
    }
    [
        agnt.set_response_format(rf)
        for agnt, rf in zip(
            agents.values(), response_formats.values()
        )
    ]
    markscheme = {
        k: update_markscheme(v) for k, v in markscheme.items()
    }
    for i, k in enumerate(markscheme.keys()):
        agents[k].set_system_message(
            system_msg.replace(
                "{subq}", k.replace("_", str(question_num))
            ).replace(
                "{question}", question,
            ).replace(
                "{subquestion}", sub_questions[k]
            ).replace(
                "{markscheme}", markscheme[k]
            ).replace(
                "{answer}", answer[k]
            ).replace(
                "{available_marks}",
                str(available_marks[k.replace("_", "total")])
            ).replace(
                "{output_response_explanation}",
                output_response_explanation
            ).replace(
            "{prior_context}", (prior_context_exp + json.dumps(
              {
                  k: {
                      "sub-question": sub_questions[k],
                      "markscheme": markscheme[k],
                      "answer": answer[k]
                  } for k in list(sub_questions.keys())[0:i]
              },
              indent=4
            )) if with_subqs and i > 0 else ""
          )
        )
    rets = unify.map(
        lambda a: a.generate(),
        list(agents.values()),
        name=f"Evals[{example_id}]->SubQAgent"
    )
    rets = [
        ret.split("```")[-2].lstrip("json")
        if "```" in ret else ret
        for ret in rets
    ]
    rets = {
        k: response_formats[k].model_validate_json(ret).model_dump()
        for k, ret in zip(markscheme.keys(), rets)
    }
    return rets
```

Finally, let's update `evaluate` accordingly.

```python
@unify.log
def evaluate(
    example_id,
    question_num,
    question,
    sub_questions,
    student_answer,
    available_marks,
    available_marks_total,
    markscheme,
    correct_marks,
    correct_marks_total,
    per_question_breakdown,
    _system_message,
):
    pred_marks = call_agent(
        example_id, _system_message, question_num, question, sub_questions, markscheme, student_answer, available_marks
    )
    pred_marks_total = sum([v["marks"] for v in pred_marks.values()])
    diff = {
        k: vcor["marks"] - vpred["marks"] for (k, vcor), (_, vpred) in
        zip(correct_marks.items(), pred_marks.items())
    }
    error = {k: abs(v) for k, v in diff.items()}
    diff_total = sum(diff.values())
    error_total = sum(error.values())
    per_question_breakdown = {
        k: {
            **per_question_breakdown[k],
            "predicted_marks": pm,
            "diff": d
        } for (k, pqb), pm, d in zip(
            per_question_breakdown.items(),
            pred_marks.values(),
            diff.values()
        )
    }
    return error
```

### 🧪 Rreun Tests

```python
with unify.Experiment("with_preceeding_context"), unify.Params(
    system_message=system_message,
    model=agent.model,
    dataset="dataset_10"
):
    unify.map(
        evaluate,
        [
             dict(**d.entries, _system_message=system_message)
             for d in test_set_10
        ],
        name="Evals"
    )
```

Great, so we've fixed the new regressions, but again we're back at the same three failures, failing for the same reason.

## 🔁 Iteration 9

### 🔍 Still Ignoring Mark Types

Given that the agent is **still** failing to follow the instructions for each mark in the markscheme, perhaps it's time we tried to perform per-mark reasoning, with a separate LLM call made for each candidate mark to award. This might help the LLM deeply consider each candidate mark mentioned in the markscheme.

Let's give it a try!

### 🔀 Queries per Mark

We will still want our per-subquestion LLM to perform the final reasoning about the number of marks to award for the sub-question, but we just want to provide it with the reasoning performed by each of our per-mark LLM queries.

We therefore now have two different LLMs, with two different roles, and therefore we need two different system messages.

Let's first update the subquestion system message, in anticipation of the incoming mark-by-mark reasoning. Let's also split the markscheme and the mark type reasoning, rather than naively combining these as was done in `update_markscheme`.

```python
subq_system_message = """
Your task is to award a suitable number of marks for a student's answer to question {subq}, from 0 up to a maximum of {available_marks} marks.

{markscheme}

{mark_types_explanation}

{mark_observations}

{output_response_explanation}
""".replace(
    "{general_guidelines}",
    general_guidelines
)
```

The `"{mark_types_explanation}"` placeholder can be overriden explicitly, giving us more control. Let's create a new function `extract_mark_type_explanation`, inspired from `update_markscheme` above.

```python
@unify.traced(name="extract_mark_type_explanation_{marks_to_consider}")
def extract_mark_type_explanation(markscheme: str, marks_to_consider=None):
    m_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r'M\d+', markscheme))))
    a_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r'A\d+', markscheme))))
    b_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r'B\d+', markscheme))))
    sc_marks = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r'SC\d+', markscheme))))
    if not any(m_marks + a_marks + b_marks + sc_marks):
        return ""
    full_exp = """As a recap, the general guidelines for each of these mark types are as follows:

{mark_types_explanation}"""
    for marks in (m_marks, a_marks, b_marks, sc_marks):
        for mark in marks:
            if marks_to_consider and mark not in marks_to_consider:
                continue
            key = "".join(c for c in mark if not c.isdigit())
            num_marks = int("".join(c for c in mark if c.isdigit()))
            exp = mark_types[key]
            exp = exp.replace(
                "{num}", str(num_marks)
            ).replace(
                "{num_marks}", "1 mark" if num_marks == 1 else f"{num_marks} marks"
            )
            full_exp = full_exp.replace(
                "{mark_types_explanation}",
                key + ":/n" + exp + "\n\n{mark_types_explanation}"
            )
    return full_exp.replace("{mark_types_explanation}", "")
```

Let's now create the system message for our mark reasoning agent, again with the explicit `{mark_types_explanation}` placeholder.

```python
mark_system_message = """
Your task is to determine whether mark {mark} should be awarded for the following student's answer to question {subq}, based on the provided markscheme.

You should populate the `thoughts` field with your thoughts on the whether the specific mark identified within the markscheme should be awarded for the student's answer.

    "{general_guidelines}",
    general_guidelines
)
```

Let's first define `call_subq_agent`, which will include mark-by-mark reasoning with several LLM calls

```python
@unify.traced(name="call_subq_agent_{subq}")
def call_subq_agent(example_id, subq, subq_agent, markscheme, mark_sys_msg):

    ]
    [
        agnt.set_response_format(ThoughtsAndAwardDecision)
        for _, agnt in mark_agents
    ]
    for i, (k, v) in enumerate(parsed_markscheme):
        mark_agents[i][1].set_system_message(
            mark_sys_msg.replace(

            ).replace(
                v, v.replace(k, f"**{k}** (to consider!)")
            ).replace(
                "{mark_types_explanation}",
                extract_mark_type_explanation(markscheme, [k])
            )
        )
    if mark_agents:
        explanation = "An expert marker has already taken a look at the student's answer, and they have made the following observations for each of the candidate marks mentioned in the markscheme. You should pay special attention to these observations."
        vals = unify.map(
            lambda a: json.loads(a.generate()),
            [agnt for _, agnt in mark_agents],
            name=f"Evals[{example_id}]->SubQAgent[{subq}]->MarkAgent"
        )
        keys = list()
        for k, _ in mark_agents:
            if k not in keys:
                keys.append(k)
                continue
            keys.append(
                k + f"({len([ky for ky in keys if k in ky])})"
            )
        mark_obs_dict = dict(zip(keys, vals))
        mark_observations = explanation + "\n\n" + json.dumps(
            mark_obs_dict, indent=4
        )
    else:
        mark_observations = ""
    subq_agent.set_system_message(
        subq_agent.system_message.replace(
            "{mark_observations}",
            mark_observations
        )
    )
    ret = subq_agent.generate()
    if "```" in ret:
        ret = ret.split("```")[-2].lstrip("json")
    ret = json.loads(ret)
    if not mark_agents:

    ret["reasoning"] = {

    }
    return ret
```

Let's now update `call_agent`, making use of our `call_subq_agent` function, which processes a single sub-question.

```python
@unify.traced

    example_id,
    subq_system_message,

):
    subq_agents = {k: agent.copy() for k in markscheme.keys()}
    with_subqs = len(markscheme) > 1
    response_formats = {

        for agnt, rf in zip(
            subq_agents.values(), response_formats.values()
        )
    ]
    mark_sys_msgs = list()
    for i, k in enumerate(markscheme.keys()):
        subq_agents[k].set_system_message(
            subq_system_message.replace(
                "{subq}", k.replace("_", str(question_num))
            ).replace(
                "{question}", question,
            ).replace(
                "{subquestion}", sub_questions[k]
            ).replace(
                "{markscheme}", markscheme[k]
            ).replace(

            ).replace(
                "{output_response_explanation}",
                output_response_explanation
            ).replace(
            "{prior_context}", (prior_context_exp + json.dumps(
              {
                  k: {
                      "sub-question": sub_questions[k],
                      "markscheme": markscheme[k],
                      "answer": answer[k]
                  } for k in list(sub_questions.keys())[0:i]
              },
              indent=4
            )) if with_subqs and i > 0 else ""
          )
        )
        mark_sys_msgs.append(
            mark_system_message.replace(
                "{subq}", k.replace("_", str(question_num))
            ).replace(
                "{question}", question,
            ).replace(
                "{subquestion}", sub_questions[k]
            ).replace(
                "{answer}", answer[k]
            ).replace(
            "{prior_context}", (prior_context_exp + json.dumps(
              {
                  k: {
                      "sub-question": sub_questions[k],
                      "markscheme": markscheme[k],
                      "answer": answer[k]
                  } for k in list(sub_questions.keys())[0:i]
              },
              indent=4
            )) if with_subqs and i > 0 else ""
          )
        )
    rets = unify.map(
        lambda *a: call_subq_agent(example_id, *a),
        list(sub_questions.keys()),
        list(subq_agents.values()),
        list(markscheme.values()),
        mark_sys_msgs,
        from_args=True,
        name=f"Evals[{example_id}]->SubQAgent"
    )
    return dict(zip(markscheme.keys(), rets))
```

We also need to update the `evaluate` function, to pass each of the two different system messages to the `call_agent` function.

```python
@unify.log
def evaluate(
    example_id,
    question_num,
    question,
    sub_questions,
    student_answer,
    available_marks,
    available_marks_total,
    markscheme,
    correct_marks,
    correct_marks_total,
    per_question_breakdown,
    _subq_system_message,
    _mark_system_message
):
    pred_marks = call_agent(
        example_id,
        _subq_system_message,
        _mark_system_message,
        question_num,
        question,
        sub_questions,
        markscheme,
        student_answer,
        available_marks
    )
    pred_marks_total = sum([v["marks"] for v in pred_marks.values()])
    diff = {
        k: vcor["marks"] - vpred["marks"] for (k, vcor), (_, vpred) in
        zip(correct_marks.items(), pred_marks.items())
    }
    error = {k: abs(v) for k, v in diff.items()}
    diff_total = sum(diff.values())
    error_total = sum(error.values())
    per_question_breakdown = {
        k: {
            **per_question_breakdown[k],
            "predicted_marks": pm,
            "diff": d
        } for (k, pqb), pm, d in zip(
            per_question_breakdown.items(),
            pred_marks.values(),
            diff.values()
        )
    }
    return error
```

### 🧪 Rreun Tests

```python
agent.set_cache("read-only")
with unify.Experiment("queries_per_mark"), unify.Params(
    subq_system_message=subq_system_message,
    mark_system_message=mark_system_message,
    model=agent.model,
    dataset="dataset_10"
):
    unify.map(
        evaluate,
        [
             dict(
                 **d.entries,
                 _subq_system_message=subq_system_message,
                 _mark_system_message=mark_system_message
            )
             for d in test_set_10[0:1]
        ],
        name="Eval",
    )
```

Great, this seems to have addressed two of the three failures (on this run at least).

## 🔁 Iteration 10

### 🔍 Method Marks Confusion

All of the prior failures now seem to have been resolved, but we have a new regression for **Example 215 (b)**. Let's take a look.

**Example 215 (b)**

❓ Question [2 Marks]:

> Complete these rows of boxes using the rule shown above.

📝 Student's Answer:

> The missing boxes are 8, 13, and 21, making the sequence 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.

☑️ Markscheme:

> Answer: 8, 13, 21
Marks: 2
Guidance:
M1 for one correct subtraction of two boxes

✅ Correct Marks [2/2] Rationale:

> Here, we deduce the missing numbers by working backwards from 34 and 55 or by applying the same rule forward. According to the markscheme (2 marks), we get full credit for the fully correct set of missing numbers, with one method mark (M1) for a correct subtraction and a final accuracy mark (A1) for the correct sequence.

🤖 Predicted Marks [0/2] Rationale:

> The candidate's final numerical answer is correct (the missing boxes are 8, 13, and 21), matching the answer in the mark scheme. However, the mark scheme specifically awards M1 for showing a correct subtraction (i.e. working that reverses the addition rule), which is a required part of the method. Since the candidate only provided the final answer without demonstrating any subtraction (or any equivalent working) to show the method, no evidence is provided to award the M1 mark. As A marks (for an accurate answer) depend on obtaining the method mark, no further marks can be awarded. Therefore, despite the correct final answer, the lack of required working means no marks should be awarded.

This is an interesting failure mode. Interestly, the justification for the "correct" (ground truth) marks is wrong. There is no **A1** mark for this question (which *would* depend on a method mark). This is irrelevant in terms of the agent failure (the agent doesn't know the correct marks or rationale), but it's still an interesting observsation regarding our "ground truth" data.

Interestingly, the agent has made the *same mistake* as occurs in the "ground truth" rationale. Our agent presumes the existence of an **A** mark where none were stated. It seems like the agent doesn't understand that correct answers should always earn full marks, unless otherwise explicitly stated. **M1** marks are not necessary to achieve full marks in such cases, unless an **A** mark is specifically referenced.

### 🔀 Clarify Mark + Answer Marks

Let's try to fully clarify these points for the sub-question agent, and re-run the evals.

```python
output_response_explanation = """
You should populate the `reasoning` field with your general thoughts on each individual mark identified in the markscheme, and also a decision as to whether each of these mark should be awarded.

If you deem that a mark *should* be awarded (such SC1, B1, A1 etc.), then it is worth as many marks as appear in the mark type itself (SC1, B1, and A1 are therefore worth 1 mark each, A2 is worth 2 marks etc.). However, these marks are not *necessarily* cumulative with regards to the total marks to award for this sub-question, and some may be irrelevant given the student's approach or answer.

More importantly, full marks should *always* be given for a fully correct answer, unless otherwise *explicitly* stated. For example, a correct answer without any method shown should still get *full marks*, despite the M1 criteria not being met. The only exception to this is explicitly referenced A marks, which do depend on the preceding M marks being awarded.

Finally, after you've given it a lot of thought, you should put the total number of marks to award for this sub-question in the `marks` field.
"""
```

### 🧪 Rreun Tests

```python
with unify.Experiment("clarify_method_marks"), unify.Params(
    subq_system_message=subq_system_message,
    mark_system_message=mark_system_message,
    model=agent.model,
    dataset="dataset_10"
):
    unify.map(
        evaluate,
        [
             dict(
                 **d.entries,
                 _subq_system_message=subq_system_message,
                 _mark_system_message=mark_system_message
            )
             for d in test_set_10
        ],
        name="Eval"
    )
```

Great, we've finally got all 10/10 tests passing perfectly 🎉
