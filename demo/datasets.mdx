title: 'Upload your Dataset'

Firstly, let's assume our app is deployed, and we have 100 active users on the platform.
We have exported these details to a `students.json` file.

We can easily upload this to the platform via the Python client.

```python
import json
import unify


with open("students.json", "r") as f:
    students = json.load(f)
unify.upload_dataset(students, name="Students")
```

Let's now create a Dataset Tab in our interface to view this Dataset.


It's easiest to create a dataset from the Python client.
Let's first get the data in the representation we actually want it.
