title: 'Usage Dashboard'
---

Let's assume our app has been deployed for a few weeks now,
and we've been tracking the daily usage coming from ~100 active users.
For now, the students answer the questions,
and then a **human** marks the questions asynchronously,
but this is both timely and expensive.

Firt things first, let's add the necessary imports,

```python
import os
import json
import wget
import random
from datetime import datetime
```

and then import unify, and activate our project.

```python
import unify
unify.activate("MarkingAssistant")
```

## Historic Data

We have the usage data exported to [usage_data.json](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/blob/main/marking_assistant/data/usage_data.json).
Let's first download this file.

```python
if not os.path.exists("usage_data.json"):
    wget.download(
        "https://github.com/unifyai/demos/"
        "raw/refs/heads/main/marking_assistant/"
        "data/usage_data.json"
    )
``` 

Let's now upload this production traffic into our new interface,
to get a complete picture.
This will take a few minutes,
as there are 10,000 logs to upload.

```python
with open("usage_data.json", "r") as f:
    usage_data = json.load(f)

unify.create_logs(context="Usage", entries=usage_data)
```

We can already start to explore the data while the upload is happening.
Let's open our "MarkingAssistant" project,
and rename the default `tab1` to `Usage`.

<Accordion title="Expand">

Let's then also set the *context* of the tab to "Usage",
so that the tab is accessing the correct data.

</Accordion>

We can then start to explore the data in the table and viewer.
Let's first explore which students are making the most use of the platform,
answering the highest volume of questions.
We can expand the table tile and remove the viewer tile for now,
we don't need it yet.
Let's then click `group by` above the `email` field.
This will group each log on a student-by-student basis,
each of which can be unfolded to see the raw data.

<Accordion title="Expand">
<img class="dark-light" width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unifyai/unifyai.github.io/refs/heads/main/img/externally_linked/docs/demo_usage_group_emails_dark.gif"/>

The reduction metrics of each numeric,
boolean and datetime group can be seen in the table.
By default the `mean` is plotted,
but this can be changed at the bottom of the table.
Let's change the metric to `count` instead,
and let's order **the groups** in ascending count order.
It doesn't matter which column we use for the group sorting,
they all have the same `count` value,
which refers to the number of logs (rows).
In this case we'll just go with the timestamp count.
With this configuration applied,
we have the students making most use shown at the top,
and those making the least use shown at the bottom.

<Accordion title="Expand">
<img class="dark-light" width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unifyai/unifyai.github.io/refs/heads/main/img/externally_linked/docs/demo_usage_sort_count_dark.gif"/>
click image to maximize
</Accordion>

We can also plot the distribution of usage across each student as a bar chart.
We first select the bar chart type in the plot,
with `student/email` for the `x` axis (unique student identifier) and `student/email -> count` for the `y` axis.
A separate bar is then plotted for each unique email address,
with the number of logs on the y axis.

Let's do a slightly more complicated example,
and find the average time in the day when males vs females are on the platform.
First, let's create a new derived column for the time of day,
by applying the `time()` function on our datetime column.

If we choose `mean` as our reduction statistic, and group by `gender`,
we'll then get the average time of day for the requests shown in the table.

Similarly, if we want to see how the average time of usage in the day varies across different ages,
we can create a scatter graph of time of day versus age. We can then click the "correlation" button,
and we'll get the correlation coefficient and line of best fit shown on the graph.

GIF [support timestamp arithmatic]

We can also split this scatter graph into male and female data if we want.

These are just examples. We can manipulate the data in all kinds of other ways.
For example, if we want to see which questions have the most marks available,
we can group by the question, and then sort by the marks available:

## Live Traffic

Finally, let's imagine we have **live** production traffic streaming in.
Let's first initialize the asynchronous logger,
for much faster (non-blocking) logging (but without catching any of the created log ids).

```python
unify.initialize_async_logger()
```

We can simulate the live production traffic by sampling from the existing usage dataset,
and updating the timstamp to be current time.

```python
random.seed(0)
while True:
    sample = random.choice(usage_data)
    sample["student/timestamp"] = datetime.now().isoformat()
    unify.log(**sample, context="Usage")
```

Let's first filter the log timestamps so we only get those which have be logged today or later,
so we don't get any of the historic data included in the table.

<Accordion title="Expand">
<img class="dark-light" width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unifyai/unifyai.github.io/refs/heads/main/img/externally_linked/docs/demo_usage_clip_timestamp.gif"/>
click image to maximize
</Accordion>

Let's then turn also on streaming mode for the table,
and then we'll see the new logs flash green as they appear in the table.
The *most recent* logs are always shown at the *top* of the table by default.

<Accordion title="Expand">
<img class="dark-light" width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unifyai/unifyai.github.io/refs/heads/main/img/externally_linked/docs/demo_usage_stream_table_dark.gif"/>
click image to maximize
</Accordion>

Let's now create a plot to monitor how the traffic is changing over time.
We can create a new plot tile,
select the histogram type,
select timestamp for the `x` axis,
and then select the number of buckets we'd like to use. Let's go with 50 buckets.

<Accordion title="Expand">
<img class="dark-light" width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unifyai/unifyai.github.io/refs/heads/main/img/externally_linked/docs/demo_usage_histogram_full.gif"/>
click image to maximize
</Accordion>

Let's now *also* turn on streaming mode for the plot,
such that the plot is also automatically updated whenever new data is available.

GIF

The plot and table will continue to grow unbounded in the current configuration.
Let's update the filter on the timestamp column,
such that we're always only retrieving logs from the past 2 minutes,
relative to the current time.

GIF

If we want to look at traffic for a particular student, we can simply filter for
this student in the table, and the plot will also be updated automatically.

GIF

Similarly, we can filter for a questions from a particular past paper,
or anything else, and again the plot will update automatically.

GIF

If we'd like to view several of these plots at the same time,
then we can simply make a clone of the table (or create a new one),
make the filtering changes to this new table,
and then create another plot which references this second table.

GIF

If you don't need to see the table on screen,
then you can simply hide the table tile.

GIF

If you're happy with your configuration,
you can explicitly save the tab.
We can then close the browser,
and when we open up the `MarkingAssistant` project,
and select our `Usage` tab,
we see the same configuration we previously saved.

GIF

This set of examples have just been a *very* simple taster of the kinds of things you can
quickly hack together in an interface for logging,
in this case focusing on the live usage data.

You should play around with this interface yourself,
and explore other useful representations you can create by juggling things around,
and applying filters, sorting, grouping, and various plots.
If you find a useful representation of the data,
then you can save this tab and come back to this view of the data at a later stage.
