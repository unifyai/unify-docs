All logs are stored inside a project.

You can create and initialize a project like so.

```python
unify.activate("my_project")
```

If your codebase needs to engage with multiple projects, you can also use context managers to switch between them.

```python
with unify.Project("my_project"):
    unify.log(x=0)
with unify.Project("my_other_project"):
    unify.log(y=1)
```

If no project is set explicitly, then the default project `"_"` is used.

```python
unify.log(x=0)
```

That's it! We'll learn more about creating logs next.
