All logs are stored inside a project. You can create and initialize a project like so.

```python
unify.activate("my_project")
```

If your codebase needs to engage with multiple projects, you can deactive the current project.

```python
unify.deactivate()
```

You can also use context managers to switch between projects, with arbitrary nesting supported.

```python
import unify

with unify.Project("my_project"):
    unify.log(x=0)
with unify.Project("my_other_project"):
    unify.log(y=1)
```

You can also overwrite a project if you'd like to start again.

```python
unify.activate("my_project", overwrite=True)
```

Check out the full [Python documentation](https://docs.unify.ai/python) for more on projects,
but that's it for our intro!
We'll learn more about creating logs next.
