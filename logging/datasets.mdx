One common use case of contexts is the creation of different datasets.

Each dataset has it's own context, such that it can easily be viewed in it's own table.

The `unify.Dataset` class is the best way to interact with your datasets from the Python client.

```python
my_dataset = unify.Dataset([0, 1, 2], name="my_dataset")
```

You can then upload this to your interface like so.

```python
my_dataset.upload()
```
