One common use case of contexts is the creation of *datasets*. Each dataset has it's own context, such that it can easily be viewed in it's own table.

The `unify.Dataset` class is the best way to interact with your datasets from the Python client.

```python
my_dataset = unify.Dataset([0, 1, 2], name="my_dataset")
```

You can then upload this to your interface like so.

```python
my_dataset.upload()
```

By default, `unify.Dataset` sets the context as `f"Datasets/{name}"`, so your dataset can be viewed at `Datasets/my_dataset`.

If your dataset already exists upstream, you can download it like so.

```python
my_dataset = unify.Dataset.from_upstream("my_dataset")
```

You can also add and remove content by value using standard Python operators.

```python
my_dataset += [3, 4, 5]
my_dataset -= [0, 1, 2]
my_dataset.upload(overwrite=True)
```
