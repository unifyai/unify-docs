title: 'Column Contexts'
---

Column contexts can be used to organize columns **inside** a table.
Taking the previous sciences example, column contexts enable us to organize the data like so.

```python
with unify.ColumnContext("Sciences"):
    with unify.ColumnContext("Maths"):
        unify.log(
            name="Zoe",
            question="what is 1 + 1?",
            region="US"
        )
    with unify.ColumnContext("Physics"):
        unify.log(
            name="John",
            question="what is the speed of light?",
            region="EU"
        )
```

Under the hood, column contexts are simply `/` separated field names, and so the below code is equivalent.

```python
unify.log(
    **{
        "Sciences/Maths/name": "Zoe",
        "Sciences/Maths/question": "what is 1 + 1?",
        "Sciences/Maths/region": "US",
    }
)
unify.log(
    **{
        "Sciences/Physics/name": "John",
        "Sciences/Physics/question": "what is the speed of light?",
        "Sciences/Physics/region": "EU",
    }
)
```

As with contexts, `unify.ColumnContext("...")` by default will also change the behaviour of `get_logs`, returning only the logs which are part of the column context.

```python
with unify.ColumnContext("Sciences"):
    with unify.ColumnContext("Maths"):
        unify.log(
            name="Zoe",
            question="what is 1 + 1?",
            region="US"
        )
        assert len(unify.get_logs()) == 1
    with unify.ColumnContext("Physics"):
        unify.log(
            name="John",
            question="what is the speed of light?",
            region="EU"
        )
        assert len(unify.get_logs()) == 1
assert len(unify.get_logs()) == 2
```

As before, this behaviour can be change by setting `unify.ColumnContext("...", mode="read")` which will only set the column context for log **getting**,
and `unify.ColumnContext("...", mode="write")` which will only set the column context for log **setting**.

Note that the `Log` instances will still show the **full field paths**, even when inside a column context.

```python
with unify.ColumnContext("Sciences"):
    with unify.ColumnContext("Maths"):
        unify.log(
            name="Zoe",
            question="what is 1 + 1?",
            region="US"
        )
        entries = unify.get_logs()[0].entries
        assert "Sciences/Maths/name" in entries
        assert "Sciences/Maths/question" in entries
        assert "Sciences/Maths/region" in entries
entries = unify.get_logs()[0].entries
assert "Sciences/Maths/name" in entries
assert "Sciences/Maths/question" in entries
assert "Sciences/Maths/region" in entries
```

Overall, column contexts make it easy to organize data inside your tables.
