title: 'Column Contexts'

Column contexts can be used to organize columns **inside** a table.
Taking the previous sciences example, column contexts enable us to organize the data like so.

```python
import unify

with unify.Log(), unify.ColumnContext("Sciences"):
    with unify.ColumnContext("Maths"):
        unify.log(
            name="Zoe",
            question="what is 1 + 1?",
            region="US"
        )
    with unify.ColumnContext("Physics"):
        unify.log(
            name="John",
            question="what is the speed of light?",
            region="EU"
        )
```

Under the hood, column contexts are simply `/` separated field names, and so the below code is equivalent.

```python
import unify

with unify.Log():
    unify.log(
        **{
            "Sciences/Maths/name": "Zoe",
            "Sciences/Maths/question": "what is 1 + 1?",
            "Sciences/Maths/region": "US",
        }
    )
    unify.log(
        **{
            "Sciences/Physics/name": "John",
            "Sciences/Physics/question": "what is the speed of light?",
            "Sciences/Physics/region": "EU",
        }
    )
```

Columns contexts can be **moved**, **hidden**, and **focused on** in the table,
making it easy to view and organize your structured data in bulk.

As with contexts, `unify.ColumnContext("...")` by default will also change the behaviour of `get_logs`,
returning only the logs which are part of the column context.

```python
import unify

with unify.ColumnContext("Sciences"):
    with unify.ColumnContext("Maths"):
        unify.log(
            name="Zoe",
            question="what is 1 + 1?",
            region="US"
        )
        assert len(unify.get_logs()) == 1
    with unify.ColumnContext("Physics"):
        unify.log(
            name="John",
            question="what is the speed of light?",
            region="EU"
        )
        assert len(unify.get_logs()) == 1
    assert len(unify.get_logs()) == 2
assert len(unify.get_logs()) == 2
```

However, note that column contexts are not disjoint. The column context `"Sciences"` **does** include both logs,
whereas the context `"Sciences"` in the earlier example **did not**.

As before, this behaviour can be change by setting `unify.ColumnContext("...", mode="read")` which will only set the column context for log **getting**,
and `unify.ColumnContext("...", mode="write")` which will only set the column context for log **setting**.

Note that the `Log` instances will still show the **full field paths**, even when inside a column context.
The getting behaviour only impacts the logs which are retrieved, not the representation of their fields.
This is in contrast to the setting behaviour, which does update the field pattern in the arguments.

```python
import unify

with unify.ColumnContext("Sciences"):
    with unify.ColumnContext("Maths"):
        unify.log(
            name="Zoe",
            question="what is 1 + 1?",
            region="US"
        )
        entries = unify.get_logs()[0].entries
        assert "Sciences/Maths/name" in entries
        assert "Sciences/Maths/question" in entries
        assert "Sciences/Maths/region" in entries
entries = unify.get_logs()[0].entries
assert "Sciences/Maths/name" in entries
assert "Sciences/Maths/question" in entries
assert "Sciences/Maths/region" in entries
```

Overall, column contexts make it easy to organize data inside your tables.
