title: 'Contexts'

By default, all logs are stored in the default context (represented by the empty string `""`).

```python
unify.log(x=0, y=1, z=2)
```

When no context is specified in the interface or the table, then the default context is used.

However, you can group your logs into *non-overlapping* contexts, which can then be displayed un separate tables.

```python
unify.log(name="Zoe", question="what is 1 + 1?", region="US", context="Traffic")
unify.log(question="what is 2 * 3?", prediction="six", answer=6, context="Evals")
```

## Context Handling

You can use `with unify.Context("..."):` to create a context, and all logging inside this block will adopt this context.

```python
with unify.Context("Traffic"):
    unify.log(name="Zoe", question="what is 1 + 1?", region="US")
    unify.log(name="John", question="what is 2 + 2?", region="EU")
```

These can also be arbitrarily nested, where each context string is joined via `/` to define the full context path.

```python
with unify.Context("Sciences"):
    with unify.Context("Maths"):
        unify.log(name="Zoe", question="what is 1 + 1?", region="US")
    with unify.Context("Physics"):
        unify.log(name="John", question="what is the speed of light?", region="EU")
```

By default, `unify.Context("...")` also change the behaviour of `get_logs`, returning only the logs relevant within the context.

```python
with unify.Context("Sciences"):
    with unify.Context("Maths"):
        unify.log(name="Zoe", question="what is 1 + 1?", region="US")
        assert len(unify.get_logs()) == 1
    with unify.Context("Physics"):
        unify.log(name="John", question="what is the speed of light?", region="EU")
        assert len(unify.get_logs()) == 1
assert len(unify.get_logs()) == 2
```

This behaviour can be change by setting `unify.Context("...", mode="read")` which will only set the context for log **getting**,
and `unify.Context("...", mode="write")` which will only set the context for log **setting**.

This makes it easy to quickly get/set different logs for different purposes throughout your codebase, without needing to manage contexts via local variables.


Note that in this case, `Sciences/Maths` and `Sciences/Physics` are **disconnected**, and both sets of logs **cannot** be viewed in a single table.

To organize data in a single table, you can use **column contexts**. We explain these in the next section!
