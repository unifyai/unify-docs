title: 'Parameters'
---

Parameters can be used to represent the **settable** parameters of an experiment or a logging task.

For example, if you're evaluating an LLM, then parameters can be used to represent the: system message, temperature, tools available etc.

Under the hood, parameters are effectively versioned entries. For clarity they are represented separately in the table.

```python
log = unify.log(score=0.5, params={"system_message": "You are a helpful assistant."})
```

When retrieving logs, parameters are returned as a `(version, value)` tuple.

```python
import json
log = unify.get_log_by_id(log.id)
print(json.dumps(log.params, indent=4))
```
```
{
    "system_message": [
        "0",
        "You are a helpful assistant."
    ]
}
```

The version is a string, which is simply an incrementing integer.
In future, we plan to support custom version naming,
thus the choice of a string rather than integer.
