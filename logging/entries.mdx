title: 'Entries'
---

Entries are the most basic unit for logging. They are simply a key-value pair.

All examples in the previous sections have logged entries.

```python
unify.log(x=0, y={"a": [1, 2, 3]}, msg="hello", score=0.123)
```

For example, `x`, `y`, `msg` and `score` above are all **entries**.

## Entry Contexts

Aside from logging contexts, we can also specify entry contexts.

```python
for grade, students in student_data.items():
    with unify.Entry(grade=grade):
        for student in students:
            unify.log(name=student)
```

These can also be nested:

```python
for subject, studate_data in all_student_data.items():
    with unify.Entry(subject=subject):
        for grade, students in student_data.items():
            with unify.Entry(grade=grade):
                for student in students:
                    unify.log(name=student)
```

By default, `unify.Entry("...")` also changes the behaviour of `get_logs`, returning only the logs which include the entry.

```python
for grade, students in {
    "A": ["Alice", "Bob"],
    "B": ["Charlie"],
    "C": ["Eve", "Frank"]
}:
    with unify.Entry(grade=grade):
        for student in students:
            unify.log(name=student)
        assert len(unify.get_logs()) == len(students)
```

This behaviour can be change by setting `unify.Entry("...", mode="read")` which will only impact log **getting**,
and `unify.Entry("...", mode="write")` which will only impact log **setting**.
