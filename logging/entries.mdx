title: 'Entries'
---

Entries are the most basic unit for logging. They are simply a key-value pair.

All examples in the previous sections have logged entries.

```python
unify.log(x=0, y={"a": [1, 2, 3]}, msg="hello", score=0.123)
```

For example, `x`, `y`, `msg` and `score` above are all **entries**.

## Entry Contexts

Aside from logging contexts, we can also specify entry contexts.

```python
import unify

student_data = {
    "A": [
        ("Alice", "Smith", "23/04/2005"),
        ("Bob", "Johnson", "12/07/2004"),
    ],
    "B": [
        ("Eve", "Brown", "15/09/2003"),
        ("Frank", "Jones", "22/11/2005"),
    ],
    "C": [
        ("Henry", "Miller", "01/01/2004"),
        ("Ian", "Davis", "10/03/2005"),
    ],
}
for grade, students in student_data.items():
    with unify.Entries(grade=grade):
        for first_name, last_name, dob in students:
            unify.log(
                first_name=first_name,
                last_name=last_name,
                data_of_birth=dob
            )
```

Which will appear like so in the table:

These can also be nested:

```python
import unify

all_student_data = {
    "Maths": {
        "A": [
            ("Alice", "Smith", "23/04/2005"),
            ("Bob", "Johnson", "12/07/2004"),
        ],
        "B": [
            ("Eve", "Brown", "15/09/2003"),
            ("Frank", "Jones", "22/11/2005"),
        ],
        "C": [
            ("Henry", "Miller", "01/01/2004"),
            ("Ian", "Davis", "10/03/2005"),
        ],
    },
    "Physics": {
        "A": [
            ("Frank", "Jones", "22/11/2005"),
        ],
        "B": [
            ("Alice", "Smith", "23/04/2005"),
            ("Eve", "Brown", "15/09/2003"),
            ("Henry", "Miller", "01/01/2004"),
            ("Ian", "Davis", "10/03/2005"),
        ],
        "C": [
            ("Bob", "Johnson", "12/07/2004"),
        ],
    },
}

for subject, studate_data in all_student_data.items():
    with unify.Entries(subject=subject):
        for grade, students in studate_data.items():
            with unify.Entries(grade=grade):
                for first_name, last_name, dob in students:
                    unify.log(
                        first_name=first_name,
                        last_name=last_name, 
                        data_of_birth=dob
                    )
```

Which will appear in the table like so:

<Accordion title="Expand">

Of course, this is not especially useful for the above example,
but if there are many nested function calls processing the data inside the `subject` or `grade` contexts,
then their use avoids the need to pass around the `subject` or `grade` contexts explicitly between all inner function calls,
when it's known that they are constant for all inner computation and logging.

By default, `unify.Entries("...")` also changes the behaviour of `get_logs`, returning only the logs which include the entry.

```python
import unify

for subject, studate_data in all_student_data.items():
    with unify.Entries(subject=subject):
        for grade, students in studate_data.items():
            with unify.Entries(grade=grade):
                for first_name, last_name, dob in students:
                    unify.log(
                        first_name=first_name,
                        last_name=last_name, 
                        data_of_birth=dob
                    )
                assert len(unify.get_logs()) == len(students)
        assert len(unify.get_logs()) == sum(
            len(students) for students in studate_data.values()
        )
```

This behaviour can be change by setting `unify.Entries("...", mode="read")` which will only impact log **getting**,
and `unify.Entries("...", mode="write")` which will only impact log **setting**.
