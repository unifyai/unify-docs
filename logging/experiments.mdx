The `unify.Experiment` class is a very simple convenience class for logging experiments.
It simply creates a parameter with the name `"experiment"`, and automatically increments the value as an ascending integer for each new experiment, if an explicit name is not provided.

```python
with unify.Experiment():
    for _ in range(10):
        unify.log(score=random.random())
```

Let's run another experiment, but give it an explicit name.

```python
with unify.Experiment("my_experiment"):
    for _ in range(10):
        unify.log(score=random.random())
```

it's often useful to use the `with unify.Experiment()` alongside a `unify.Parameter()` to represent the settable parameters of an experiment.

```python
with unify.Experiment("final_experiment"), unify.Parameter(
    system_message="You are a helpful assistant."
):
    for _ in range(10):
        unify.log(score=random.random())
```

You can also use negative indexing, and the `overwrite` argument. For example, the following will overwrite the previous experiment.
Integers are interpreted as the experiment version, and strings are interpreted as the experiment name.

```python
with unify.Experiment(-1, overwrite=True), unify.Parameter(
    system_message="You are a *great* assistant."
):
    for _ in range(10):
        unify.log(score=random.random())
```
