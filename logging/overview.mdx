Logs enable you to store **any** kind of data to use in your interfaces üìä

All logging features are supported the [REST API](https://docs.unify.ai/api-reference),
but our Python client provides more convenient abstractions on top of the basic logging primitives.

Just `unify.log` your data and you're ready to go üöÄ

```python
import unify
unify.log(x=0, y={"a": [1, 2, 3]}, msg="hello", score=0.123)
```

Every LLM product has **unique** and **changing** requirements, as do the **users**.
Your logging platform and LLM infra should reflect this!

We've tried to make Unify as **(a) simple**, **(b) modular** and **(c) hackable** as possible,
so you can quickly probe, analyze, and iterate on the data that's important for **you**, your **product** and your **users** ‚ö°
