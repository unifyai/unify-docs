title: 'Logs'

Logs can be used to store pretty much **anything** to your interface.

## Basics

Let's create our first log.

```python
import unify
unify.log(x=0, y={"a": [1, 2, 3]}, msg="hello", score=0.123)
```

Logs appear as **rows** in tables, and fields appear as **columns**

## Logging Contexts

If you want to incrementally update the *same* log (row),
then you can use `with unify.Log():` to create a logging context, and all calls to `unify.log` will then update this existing log.

```python
```

These can also be arbitrarily nested.

```python
```

We can also pass arguments, which will also be part of the same log.

```python
```

Using `with unify.Log()` is the best practice, as this avoids the need to log handles throughout your program.
For example, this code:

```python
```

Is much cleaner than this code:

```python
```
