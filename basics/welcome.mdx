Unify is a **fully hackable** LLMOps platform, which you can use to build *custom* interfaces for:
logging 📋, evals ⚖️, guardrails 🛡️, labelling 🏷️, tracing 🔀, agents 🤖, human feedback 🧑‍💻, optimization 📈 and anything else you can think of ✨

Just `unify.log` your data, and add an interface using the four building blocks:

- tables 🔢
- views 🔍
- plots 📊
- editor 🕹️ (coming soon)

Every LLM product has unique and changing requirements, as do the users. Your infra should reflect this!

We've tried to make Unify as **(a) simple**, **(b) modular** and **(c) hackable** as possible,
so you can quickly probe, analyze, and iterate on the data that's important for **you**, your **product** and your **users** ⚡
