title: 'Welcome to Unify!'
---

Unify is a **fully hackable** LLMOps platform, which you can use to build *personalized* pipelines for: logging, evaluations, guardrails, human labelling, agentic workflows, self-optimization, and more.

simply `unify.log` your data, and then compose your own custom interface using the four core building blocks: (1) **tables**, (2) **plots**, (3) **visualizations**, and (4) **terminals**.

Despite the explosion of LLM tools, many of these are inflexible, overly abstracted, and complex to navigate.

Tooling requirements constantly change across *projects*, across *teams*, and across *time*. We've therefore made Unify as simple, modular and hackable as possible, so you can spin up and iterate on the *exact* AI platform that **you** need, in **seconds** âš¡
