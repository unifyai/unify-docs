Once you've signed up, you'll need to add your card details on the [billing page](https://console.unify.ai/billing).
You can see your credits, top-up, and set automatic refills for [Universal API](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api) usage.

You can also get your credit balance with the following HTTP request:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/credits' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY"
```

which will return something like:

```json
{
    "id": "your_user_id",
    "credits": 232.32
}
```

This is also supported in our Python client:

```python
import unify
credits = unify.get_credits()
```

If you don't need access to the universal API, then there is no need to add biliing informaton.
You can create as many [interfaces](https://docs.unify.ai/interfaces) as you want for personal projects at no cost.
For professional use cases, check out our [Pricing Page](https://unify.ai/pricing).

That's it, you're now ready to dive in and learn more about the platform ðŸ¤¿
