Once you've signed up, you'll need to add your card details on the [billing page](https://console.unify.ai/billing).

Simply press `GO TO PORTAL`, then `Add payment method`, and then your **$10 free credits** will then be unlocked ðŸ’¸

Going forward, you then only have to manage the balance for your Unify account,
and we handle the spending with each provider behind the scenes.

You can see your balance, top-up your balance, and set automatic refills on the
[billing page](https://console.unify.ai/billing).

You can also get your current credit balance with the following HTTP request:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/credits' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY"
```

which will return something like:

```json
{
    "id": "your_user_id",
    "credits": 232.32
}
```

This is also supported in our Python client:

```python
import unify
credits = unify.get_credits()
```

That's it, you're now ready to dive in and learn more about the platform ðŸ¤¿
