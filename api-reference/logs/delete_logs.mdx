title: 'Delete Logs'
api: 'DELETE /v0/logs'
---
Deletes log entries based on specified criteria. Can delete both base logs and derived logs.

If a context is provided, logs will be removed from that context instead of being entirely
deleted, unless it is the last context associated with the log. This allows logs to be
shared across multiple contexts and only removed from specific contexts when needed.

Args:
    source_type: Controls which type of logs to delete:
        - 'all': Delete both base and derived logs (default)
        - 'base': Only delete base logs
        - 'derived': Only delete derived logs

#### Authorizations

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required="true">
  Bearer authentication header of the form `Bearer <token>`, where `<token>` is your auth token.
</ParamField>

#### Query Parameters

<ParamField query="delete_empty_logs" type="boolean" >
Whether to delete logs which end up being empty as a result of the field deletion.
</ParamField>

#### Body

<ParamField body="project" type="string" required="true">
Name of the project the logs belong to.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="context" type="string | null" >
Optional context path to update for the logs. Can use '/' for nested contexts (e.g. 'training/batch1').
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="ids_and_fields" type="[array]" required="true">
List of tuples of log ID(s) and field(s) to delete, either as an individual item or a list of items. A log ID of None indicates that the field should be deleted from all logs.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source_type" type="string"  default={"all"}>
Specifies which type of logs to delete. Can be 'base' for base logs only, 'derived' for derived logs only, or 'all' to delete from both types.
</ParamField>
